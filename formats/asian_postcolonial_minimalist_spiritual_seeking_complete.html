<h2 id="chapter-1-1"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
<p>Sunlight fell through the jalousie windows, cutting the dust into
precise, geometric bars. On the floor, a single mat. A single bowl. A
space so empty it hummed.</p>
<p>Auntie Li had said the key would be under the blue ceramic frog by
the pot of stubborn ixora. She had not said what to do if the frog was
gone. She had not said what to do if the rain felt like it would last
for days, and the jet lag was a hollow ringing in my bones, and the
address I’d memorised—28B Spottiswoode Park Road—seemed less like a
location and more like a incantation that had failed to work.</p>
<p>I had left London seventy-two hours ago. Not left. Unmoored. There
was no dramatic rupture, no fired job or broken heart. There was only a
quiet, accumulating certainty, like dust on a windowsill, that the life
I was building was not a life, but a very convincing replica. I worked
in archival restoration at the British Library, piecing together
Victorian botanical manuscripts. My hands were skilled at repairing the
tears in pressed flowers, in mixing watercolours to match faded
cochineal pinks. I lived in a white-painted flat in Crouch End with a
philodendron I sometimes forgot to water. I had a boyfriend, Mark, who
talked about ski trips and ISAs. The silence between us had grown so
thick it had its own texture, like felt.</p>
<p>The unravelling began with a box. A donation to the archive, from the
estate of a colonial administrator who had served in the Straits
Settlements. Inside, among the usual ledgers and dry correspondence, was
a sketchbook. It was small, bound in cracked leather the colour of old
blood. The pages were not filled with official records, but with pencil
drawings of trees. Not scientific renderings. These were intimate,
almost restless. The frantic scribble of rain-tree roots cracking a
sidewalk. The skeletal elegance of a angsana in winter, which was not
winter at all, but the <em>shedding</em> season. On the last page, in a
cramped, tired hand, was written: <em>To know a place, learn its trees.
They are the true historians. They remember the soil. They remember the
silence before the words.</em></p>
<p>I touched that page with my cotton-gloved finger. The paper was soft,
thirsty. I felt a jolt, clean and sharp as a paper cut. It was the first
true feeling in months.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I gave notice on the flat. Mark said, “Singapore?
That’s random.” He did not ask to come. I sold or gave away everything
that wouldn’t fit in the bruise-coloured suitcase. My mother, in our
weekly call from Kuala Lumpur, was cautiously pleased. “Good. You are
too pale. You need some sun, some soup.” She did not ask about the
leaving, only about the arriving. That was her way.</p>
<p>The rain softened from a wall to a curtain. I took a breath of the
thick, washed air and stepped out, the suitcase wheels clacking over the
wet seams of the pavement. The shophouses were a parade of restored
perfection: fresh coats of pastel paint, gleaming brass number plates,
chic cafes with minimalist signage. Number 28B was not like them. Its
paint was a faded ochre, peeling at the window frames like sunburnt
skin. The ixora by the door was a riot of red blooms, defiantly untidy.
And there, half-hidden in the damp soil, was the frog. Not blue, but a
weathered turquoise, one chipped eye staring blankly upward.</p>
<p>The key was there, cold and solid. The lock turned with a groan.</p>
<p>The smell hit me first: closed-up air, lemongrass from a reed
diffuser stuck in a corner, and underneath it all, the scent of old wood
and mildew—the smell of a house that has been breathing slowly, on its
own, for a long time. The front room was a shadowy rectangle, slatted
light from the shutters painting bars on the terrazzo floor. Furniture
stood under white sheets, like a gathering of quiet ghosts. A staircase,
steep and dark, led upwards.</p>
<p>Auntie Li was my mother’s cousin’s wife. I had met her once, at a
wedding when I was twelve. She was a small, sharp woman who had pinched
my cheek and said, “So English already.” She had moved to Penang to care
for her own mother, leaving this, her late husband’s family house,
empty. “You can stay,” she’d said over the phone, her voice crackling
with distance. “Keep the ghosts company. Just don’t let the termites
have it.”</p>
<p>I pulled a sheet from the nearest shape. It was a rosewood sofa,
carved with peonies. I ran a hand over the arm. The wood was cool, the
grain like a frozen river. My phone buzzed in my pocket. Mark. A text:
<em>You get in ok?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, I typed back. <em>House is old.</em></p>
<p>Three dots appeared, then vanished. No reply came.</p>
<p>The silence of the house was different from the silence of my London
flat. That was a hollow silence, a silence of absence. This was a
<em>full</em> silence. It hummed. It held the echoes of countless
monsoon rains, of family arguments in Hokkien and English, of the sizzle
of woks from the kitchen at the back. I could feel it against my skin,
like pressure.</p>
<p>I wheeled my suitcase to the foot of the stairs. It was too heavy to
lift. I would have to unpack down here, carry things up in increments.
The thought was exhausting. Instead, I walked through to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>It was a time capsule. Green ceramic tiles. A squat, two-burner gas
stove. A large, single-door refrigerator that probably hadn’t run in
years. On a Formica table, covered in a plastic lace cloth, was a note
weighed down by a jar of <em>kaya</em>.</p>
<p><em>Ming, Welcome. Electricity is on. Water heater switch is outside
bathroom. Don’t use the tap in the backyard—pipe is broken. Market is at
end of road, turn left. The tree man comes on Fridays. – Auntie
Li</em></p>
<p><em>The tree man.</em> I put the note down. Through the kitchen
window, barred with wrought iron, I saw the backyard. It was a small
square of concrete, moss staining its corners. But in the centre,
growing straight through a hole in the concrete, was a tree.</p>
<p>It was not a big tree. Its trunk was slender, wrapped in a smooth,
pale bark that looked almost silver in the wet light. Its leaves were a
glossy, dark green, oval-shaped with a delicate point. It held itself
with a peculiar grace, this tree growing in a cage of concrete, its
branches reaching over the high walls as if searching for something it
remembered. It was utterly, heartbreakingly alone.</p>
<p>I unlocked the back door and stepped out. The rain had stopped. The
air steamed. I walked to the tree and placed my palm flat against its
trunk. It was cool and damp. I half-expected a vibration, a pulse, some
echo of the jolt from the sketchbook. There was only the solid, silent
fact of it. A living thing in a stone yard.</p>
<p>A voice came from over the wall. “It’s a <em>Tembusu</em>.”</p>
<p>I snatched my hand back. A man’s head and shoulders appeared above
the neighbouring wall. He was perhaps in his sixties, his hair short and
grey, his face a landscape of gentle wrinkles. He wore a simple grey
singlet.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to—”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s a good tree.” His voice was low, raspy, as if used
infrequently. “Very stubborn. They paved around it, you see. Thirty
years ago. They thought it would die. It just… slowed down.”</p>
<p>I looked up at the branches. “What’s a Tembusu?”</p>
<p>“A memory tree,” he said. He rested his arms on the wall. “Its wood
is hard. Good for chopping blocks. Its flowers smell very strong at
night. Like… regret and sugar.” He said it not poetically, but as a
simple fact. “You are the niece?”</p>
<p>“Great-niece. Ming.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” He nodded. “I am Mr. Goh. Next door. Since before you were a
thought.” He looked at the tree, then at my suitcase still visible
through the kitchen door. “You are staying.”</p>
<p>“For a while.”</p>
<p>“Good. The house needs breathing.” He pushed himself back from the
wall. “The rain will come again. Close your windows on the west
side.”</p>
<p>His head disappeared. I was alone again with the tree. <em>A memory
tree.</em> I looked at its leaves, still dripping diamonds onto the
concrete. I thought of the sketchbook in the archive, the frantic roots,
the skeletal branches. <em>They remember the soil.</em></p>
<p>I went inside, the damp already settling on my skin. Upstairs, I
found a bedroom with a wrought-iron bedframe and a thin mattress. The
single window looked out over a narrow alley to the back of another row
of shophouses. I opened it, and the sound of the city rushed in—the
distant groan of traffic, the clatter of a food cart, a snippet of a
radio song in Mandarin. It was not the quiet hum of my Crouch End
street. This was a layered, living sound.</p>
<p>I lay down on the bare mattress, the iron pressing through into my
back. The jet lag was a tide now, pulling me under. I thought of Mark,
of his unanswered text. I thought of the meticulous, colour-coded
spreadsheet I’d made for this move, now useless in my phone. I thought
of the Tembusu, its roots pushing patiently against the concrete, its
memory of forest soil deep below the pipes and cables and
foundations.</p>
<p>Sleep came, not as a rest, but as a sinking. I dreamed not of trees,
but of paper. I was in the archive, but the sketchbook was empty. I was
frantically mixing paints, trying to match a colour I could no longer
see. A colour between ochre and turquoise, between regret and sugar. My
brush hovered over the page, but I had forgotten the shape of the
leaf.</p>
<p>I woke in the deep blue hour before dawn. The house was dark. The
full silence was back. And from the backyard, carried on a faint, cool
breeze through the window, came a scent. Cloying, sweet, piercingly
strong. It filled the room, this scent of night flowers.</p>
<p>I got up and went to the window. I couldn’t see the tree from here,
but I could smell it. <em>Like regret and sugar.</em></p>
<p>Mr. Goh was right. The Tembusu was flowering.</p>
<p>Downstairs, in the ghost-filled living room, I opened my suitcase. I
took out the few clothes, the toiletries, the small pouch of restoration
tools I couldn’t leave behind. At the very bottom, wrapped in a piece of
soft flannel, was the thing I had stolen.</p>
<p>It was not the sketchbook. That was still in the archive, catalogued
and safe. It was a single, loose page. The one with the sentence. <em>To
know a place, learn its trees.</em></p>
<p>I had not planned to take it. On my last day, as I was cleaning out
my locker, I had slipped it from its Mylar sleeve. A tremor went through
me, a thief’s thrill that was also a ache. It was the only thing I took
that wasn’t mine.</p>
<p>I unfolded it now on the rosewood sofa. In the dim light, the pencil
lines were faint ghosts. I traced the words with my finger, not the
gloved, archival finger, but my own bare skin.</p>
<p>The first bird of dawn called, a sharp, clear note that cut through
the scent of the flowers. A motorbike coughed to life somewhere. The
city was waking up.</p>
<p>I folded the page and put it in the pocket of my trousers. I walked
to the kitchen, filled a chipped ceramic cup with water from the tap,
and drank. The water tasted of chlorine and old pipes.</p>
<p>Then I went to the back door, opened it, and stood on the concrete,
facing the Tembusu. The sky was lightening to a mother-of-pearl grey.
The flowers were small, creamy clusters, almost invisible against the
leaves, but their perfume owned the air.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said to the tree, to the house, to the silence. My voice
sounded strange here, too crisp, too English. I tried again, softer.
“Okay.”</p>
<p>I was here.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-2-1"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>The market at the end of the road was not a place you found. It was a
place that found you, pulling you in by a thousand threads of smell and
sound. It began with the metallic shriek of a grinder sharpening knives,
a spark-showering aria that cut through the humid morning. Then the
smells: overripe jackfruit, the clean sting of chopped ginger, the
pungent, life-affirming funk of dried shrimp and salted fish. Stalls
spilled onto the five-foot way, a taxonomy of necessity: pyramids of
spiky durians next to meticulous stacks of folded <em>kangkung</em>,
blue plastic tubs of live, flipping fish, their mouths gasping in slow
motion.</p>
<p>I moved through the current, a stone in a stream. My London
clothes—linen trousers, a plain cotton t-shirt—felt like a costume. The
aunties in their floral <em>samfu</em> and slip-on sandals assessed me
with glances that were neither friendly nor hostile, but purely
diagnostic. <em>Not local. Not tourist. What is she?</em></p>
<p>I had come for practical things: eggs, rice, coffee. But the sheer
specificity of everything was paralyzing. What kind of rice? There were
sacks labelled “Jasmine,” “Basmati,” “Thai Hom Mali,” “Sushi,” and one
simply called “Old Uncle’s Preferred.” The eggs came in trays of ten,
twenty, or thirty, brown or white, some stamped with red Chinese
characters promising mountain-fed hens. I stood, adrift.</p>
<p>“You block the way.”</p>
<p>The voice was matter-of-fact. I turned. An elderly woman sat on a
stool behind a mountain of bitter melons. Her face was a walnut shell of
wrinkles, her eyes bright black buttons. She wore a striped apron.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I mumbled, stepping aside.</p>
<p>“First time.” It wasn’t a question. She picked up a melon, her
knotted fingers probing its warty skin. “You live in Li’s house.”</p>
<p>News travelled in capillaries here, not wires. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. That house is too quiet.” She put the melon down, selected
another. “You want bitter melon?”</p>
<p>“I… don’t know how to cook it.”</p>
<p>She looked at me as if I’d said I didn’t know how to breathe. “You
learn. Good for cooling the blood. Too much city heat makes people
stupid.” She bagged two melons, thin and green as jealousy, and thrust
them at me. “Five dollars.”</p>
<p>I fumbled for my wallet. As I handed her the note, she said, “The
tree man was here yesterday. For Li. He said the Tembusu has a hollow.
You tell Li.”</p>
<p>“The tree man?”</p>
<p>“Friday,” she said, as if explaining to a child. “Today is Friday. He
comes. You didn’t see the card?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t. I took the bag, the melons bumping against my leg. “Thank
you.”</p>
<p>“Eat the melon with black beans. And garlic. Not too much salt.” She
waved me away, her attention already on the next customer.</p>
<p>I bought rice (“Old Uncle’s Preferred”), eggs (brown, ten), and a
small bag of coffee grounds that smelled of earth and smoke. As I turned
to leave, I saw a card taped to the side of a drinks stall, fluttering
in the fan’s breeze. It was simple, white, the text in clean black
type:</p>
<p><strong>ARBOR CULTURE</strong> <em>Tree Care | Consultation |
Heritage Specimens</em> <em>K. S. Lim</em> <em>A phone number.</em></p>
<p>I memorised the number. <em>Arbor Culture.</em> Not “Tree Cutting” or
“Garden Services.” <em>Culture.</em> It implied a relationship.</p>
<p>Back at 28B, the morning light had climbed the walls, baking the damp
from the terrazzo. The house felt different in the day—less a repository
of ghosts, more a sleepy animal. I put the groceries on the Formica
table and saw a new note next to the <em>kaya</em> jar.</p>
<p><em>Ming, The tree man, Mr. Lim, came. He says the Tembusu has a
hollow at the base, from the old paving. He will come back to talk. Be
nice to him. He knows more about roots than people. – A. Li</em></p>
<p><em>Be nice to him.</em> As if I would be otherwise. I put the bitter
melons in the empty refrigerator, which hummed to life with a startling,
vibrating rattle. I made coffee with a small pot I found in a cupboard,
its enamel chipped to reveal black iron beneath. It tasted brutal and
necessary.</p>
<p>The hollow. I went to the backyard. In the stark daylight, the tree’s
situation seemed more brutal, more miraculous. The concrete formed a
perfect, tight seal around the base of the trunk, like a manacle. I
crouched, running my fingers over the junction where bark met stone. On
the side facing the kitchen wall, hidden from casual view, was a dark
opening, about the size of my fist. A cavity. Inside, it was shadowy, a
void. I thought of decay, of weakness. A hollow tree could fall.</p>
<p>“It’s not a sickness.”</p>
<p>I started, nearly losing my balance. A man stood in the open gateway
to the alley. I hadn’t heard the gate open. He was tall, lean, dressed
in faded olive-green work trousers and a grey t-shirt. He looked to be
in his late forties, his face all angles—sharp cheekbones, a strong jaw
softened by a day’s stubble. His hair was black, threaded with silver,
cut short. But it was his hands I noticed first. They were large, the
fingers long, the skin etched with a fine lattice of scars and stains
that no soap would ever remove. They hung at his sides, still, as if
accustomed to waiting.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lim?”</p>
<p>He gave a slight nod. “Kai.” His eyes were on the tree, not on me.
They were a dark brown, almost black, and they moved over the Tembusu
with a focus that felt physical, like a touch. “The hollow. It’s not a
disease. It’s a negotiation.”</p>
<p>“A negotiation?”</p>
<p>“With the concrete.” He walked into the yard, his movements quiet,
deliberate. He didn’t look at me as he spoke; his dialogue was with the
tree. “When they paved, they wounded it. The tree sealed off the damaged
wood. Created a boundary. The hollow is the space it surrendered, to
save the rest.” He finally glanced at me. “A retreat is not a defeat.
It’s a strategy for survival.”</p>
<p>His voice was calm, low. It held no salesman’s pitch, no false
concern. It stated facts as the tree might state them, if it could
speak.</p>
<p>“Will it fall?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not because of this.” He crouched where I had crouched, his back to
me. He did not touch the tree immediately. He looked. He breathed. Then
he placed his palm flat against the bark, beside the hollow, and closed
his eyes for a three-count. When he opened them, he said, “The roots are
deep. They found the old soil, below the pipes. It’s stable. But the
hollow can hold water. Breed insects. It needs to breathe.” He stood,
brushing dust from his knees. “I can clean it. Treat it. But it is part
of the tree’s story now. You don’t erase a story. You just make sure it
doesn’t end the book.”</p>
<p>I stared at him. This was not how arborists spoke in documentaries.
“Auntie Li said you’d come to talk.”</p>
<p>“I am talking.” A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips.
It was gone quickly. “You are Ming. From London.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You restore paper.”</p>
<p>This stopped me. “How did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Auntie Li. She told my mother, who goes to the same temple.
Information travels.” He looked around the yard, at the moss, the high
walls. “Paper and trees. Not so different. Both hold memory. Both are
fragile.”</p>
<p>The coincidence, if it was one, felt like a hook in my chest. “I saw
a sketchbook. Of trees. Here. In Singapore. It’s why I came.”</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, studying me. The diagnostic look of the
market aunties, but deeper, quieter. “Many people come to Singapore for
many reasons. Money. Food. Family. Not for trees in a book.” He didn’t
say it judgmentally. “What will you do here?”</p>
<p>The question, so simple, laid bare the vast blankness of my plan. “I…
don’t know yet. Stay. Look.”</p>
<p>He nodded, as if “look” was a sufficient answer. “The treatment for
the hollow. It is not expensive, but it is not free. You need to ask
Auntie Li.”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay for it,” I heard myself say. I had savings, a buffer. This
felt important. Not a duty, but a first step.</p>
<p>He considered this. “Okay. I can do it next week. Wednesday morning.
Early, before the sun is on this wall.” He took a small, worn notebook
from his back pocket, wrote something, tore out the page. It was a
figure, neat and precise. “This is the cost. You can change your mind.”
He handed it to me. Our fingers did not touch.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Lim.”</p>
<p>“Kai,” he corrected. He gave the Tembusu one last look. “The flowers
will fade in a week. The scent will go. But the tree remains.” He turned
and left through the alley gate, closing it softly behind him.</p>
<p>I stood in the yard, the quote on the paper in my pocket. <em>To know
a place, learn its trees.</em> Kai Lim knew trees. He spoke of hollows
as negotiations, of roots finding old soil. He had hands that read bark
like braille.</p>
<p>The house felt different when I went back inside. It was no longer
just a shell I occupied. It was a node in a network—connected to the
bitter melon seller, to Auntie Li’s temple gossip, to a tree man who saw
stories in wood. I was the foreign element, the unknown variable.</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon uncovering the house. I took the sheets off the
furniture. A solid dining table. Four chairs with cane seats. A
sideboard that held a dusty set of ceramic bowls. Upstairs, in a small
study, I found a bookshelf. Most of the books were in Chinese,
leather-bound classics. But on the bottom shelf was a stack of old
<em>National Geographic</em> magazines from the 1970s, and a single,
thin volume in English: <em>Common Trees of Singapore and Malaya.</em>
Its spine was cracked, its pages foxed with brown spots.</p>
<p>I sat on the floor and opened it. It was a field guide, with line
drawings and dry descriptions. I flipped until I found it: <em>Fagraea
fragrans. Tembusu. A hardy evergreen… timber is hard and durable…
flowers are creamy white, strongly fragrant at night.</em></p>
<p>I read the entry twice. It told me nothing of negotiations or memory.
It was a skeleton. Kai Lim had offered the flesh.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed. My mother. I answered.</p>
<p>“Ming. You are alive.” Her voice was crisp, long-distance. “The house
is okay? Not too dirty?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Ma. A bit old.”</p>
<p>“Old is good. Solid. You eat? You look thin on the video call last
time.”</p>
<p>“I just went to the market.”</p>
<p>“Good. Listen.” Her tone shifted, into the realm of practical
announcements. “Auntie Li says you met the tree man. Lim. His family is
good people. From Johor. His father was a gardener for the British, then
for the government. He knows his business. You be respectful.”</p>
<p>“I was, Ma.”</p>
<p>“Good. Also, Mark called me.”</p>
<p>The sentence landed like a dropped dish. “What? Why?”</p>
<p>“He is worried. He says you are not answering his texts properly. He
thinks you are… having a crisis.” She said the word as if it were a
mild, embarrassing rash.</p>
<p>“I’m not having a crisis. I’m just… here.”</p>
<p>“Mm.” It was a sound of profound skepticism. “To be alone in an old
house is not ‘just here,’ Ming. It is a choice. He is a good boy, Mark.
Steady. But maybe not for you. A crisis is not always a bad thing.
Sometimes it is just a turning.”</p>
<p>I was speechless. My mother, the pragmatist, the soup-maker, was
offering romantic philosophy.</p>
<p>“Don’t let the tree man charge you too much,” she said, reverting to
type. “And drink more water. The heat there steals your moisture from
the inside.”</p>
<p>We hung up. I leaned against the bookshelf. Mark had called my
mother. It was a move of such staggering, clueless intimacy that I
couldn’t decide if I was angry or sad. He was trying to fix me, from
seven thousand miles away, using the wrong tools. He was trying to
repair a tear with the wrong shade of paint.</p>
<p>The blue hour descended again. I made rice, scrambling an egg with a
dash of soy sauce. I attempted the bitter melon, slicing it open to
reveal its startling, white pith and seeds. I scooped them out, sliced
the green flesh, and fried it with black beans and garlic, as
instructed. It was appallingly bitter, a taste that shocked my tongue
and then, slowly, revealed a clean, mineral aftertaste. <em>Good for
cooling the blood.</em></p>
<p>I ate on the steps of the back door, watching the Tembusu become a
silhouette against the indigo sky. The cloying scent of the flowers was
beginning to rise again. <em>Regret and sugar.</em></p>
<p>I thought of Kai Lim’s hands. I thought of the hollow—a negotiation,
a surrendered space. I thought of my life in London, the neat,
colour-coded replica. Had I created a hollow there? Sealed off a damaged
part to save the rest? What had I surrendered?</p>
<p>The sketchbook page in my pocket seemed to pulse with a quiet heat. I
had come looking for the trees from the drawings. But the first tree I’d
met had a story no sketch could capture—a story of concrete and
resilience, of hollows and deep, seeking roots. And the man who cared
for it spoke of it not as a problem to be solved, but as a history to be
respected.</p>
<p>A gecko chirped from the kitchen wall. <em>Chik-chik-chik.</em> A
sound as old as the tropics.</p>
<p>I finished the bitter melon, every bite. The bitterness was a truth I
had to swallow. I washed the plate, the cold water shocking my
wrists.</p>
<p>Upstairs, in the iron bed, I listened. The city’s night sounds were a
different symphony. Fewer engines, more insects. The occasional shout
from a nearby supper club. The relentless, rhythmic chirping of the
geckos.</p>
<p>I did not dream of paper. I dreamed of roots. A slow, patient, dark
pushing through resistant earth. A seeking for the old soil, the true
soil, far beneath the paved world.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-3-1"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></h2>
<p>Wednesday arrived on a tide of heat. By 7 a.m., the sun was a white
coin in a bleached sky, and the air in the backyard was already thick,
pressing down on the concrete and the lone tree. I was dressed, coffee
drunk, a nervous energy making my hands feel clumsy. I kept checking the
alley gate.</p>
<p>At five minutes past seven, it opened. Kai Lim entered, followed by a
younger man—maybe early twenties—pushing a handcart laden with tools,
buckets, and a small metal tank. The young man had Kai’s sharp
cheekbones but a softer expression, and his hair was dyed a faint,
reddish brown at the tips.</p>
<p>“This is my nephew, Ah Boon,” Kai said. His greeting was a nod. He
wore the same work trousers, a fresh grey t-shirt. His eyes went
immediately to the Tembusu, assessing the light on its trunk. “We’ll
start.”</p>
<p>There was no small talk. Ah Boon unloaded the cart with efficient,
quiet movements. He set up a tripod with a professional-looking camera,
then began arranging tools on a clean tarp: curved scrapers, wire
brushes, a small handsaw, bottles of solutions, a syringe-like injector.
It looked less like construction and more like surgery.</p>
<p>Kai approached the tree. He did the same thing as before: a moment of
stillness, a palm placed on the bark. Then he took a piece of chalk from
his pocket and drew a light, square outline around the hollow. “We open
this a little. Clean. No more than necessary.” He spoke to Ah Boon, but
it was for my benefit too. “The tree has already built its barrier. We
are just… tidying the edges.”</p>
<p>He took a slender scraper and began, with infinite care, to remove
the crumbling, rotten wood from the lip of the hollow. The sound was a
soft, dry scratching. Fragments of wood, dark and damp, fell onto the
tarp below. Ah Boon moved the camera, taking close-up pictures from
different angles.</p>
<p>“Documentation,” Kai said, seeing my look. “For the tree’s history.
Before, during, after.”</p>
<p>I sat on the back step, watching. It was intensely intimate. This
wasn’t pruning or watering; this was interacting with a wound, with the
tree’s private struggle. Kai’s hands were mesmerizing. They were never
harsh, never hurried. The scraper was an extension of his finger,
probing, feeling, discerning between what was dead and what was merely
sleeping. His concentration was absolute. The noisy city, the heat, my
presence—all seemed to fall away from the sphere of his focus.</p>
<p>After an hour, the hollow was slightly larger, but its edges were
clean, showing smooth, healthy wood where the tree had compartmentalized
the damage. Inside, the cavity was a dark, neat chamber.</p>
<p>“See here,” Kai said, pointing with the tip of the scraper. A line,
like a seam in the wood, ran vertically inside the hollow. “This is the
boundary wall. The tree made this. On this side,” he tapped outside the
seam, “is living tissue. On that side,” he gestured into the darkness,
“is what it sacrificed. A life for a life.”</p>
<p>He mixed a solution in a small bucket, a clear liquid with a sharp,
clean smell like pine and alcohol. With a brush, he painted the entire
interior of the cavity. “This helps. Prevents rot. Encourages the bark
to callus over, in time.” His movements were methodical, a priest
anointing an altar.</p>
<p>Finally, he took the syringe-like tool. It was filled with a foam
that expanded as he injected it gently into the deepest part of the
hollow, near the base. “This fills the space, but it’s breathable. It
supports, but doesn’t strangle. And it’s soft. If the tree wants to grow
into it, it can.”</p>
<p>When he finished, he stepped back. The hollow was now a clean,
treated wound, partly filled with pale foam. It looked cared for, not
cured. There was no pretending it wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Ah Boon took more photographs. Kai cleaned his tools meticulously,
wiping each one with a rag before placing it back on the tarp. The
silence was companionable, filled with the completion of a precise
task.</p>
<p>“Will it flower again?” I asked. My voice sounded too loud.</p>
<p>Kai looked at the canopy. “Yes. Maybe not as much this season. It
spent energy on this.” He gestured to the hollow. “But next year. It is
a stubborn tree.”</p>
<p>Ah Boon began packing the cart. Kai came over to the steps, accepting
the glass of water I offered. He drank it all in one long pull, his
throat working.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. “For showing me. For explaining.”</p>
<p>“Understanding is part of the care.” He handed the glass back. “You
are not like Auntie Li. She would have just said ‘fix it and send the
bill.’”</p>
<p>“I’m not from here.”</p>
<p>“I know.” He looked at me directly then, and his dark eyes held a
quiet curiosity. “The sketchbook you saw. What trees were in it?”</p>
<p>The question caught me off guard. I fumbled for description. “Rain
trees. Angsana. A fig, I think, with aerial roots. They weren’t… calm
drawings. They were urgent.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. “The artist saw the tension. Most people see the
green. They don’t see the fight.” He paused. “There is a rain tree. In
the Botanic Gardens. Near Swan Lake. It is… significant. It was planted
when the gardens were first made. It has seen everything.” He said it
not as a tour guide fact, but as a piece of intelligence. “If you are
looking for trees with stories, start there.”</p>
<p>He gave a brief instruction to Ah Boon in rapid Hokkien, then turned
back to me. “The bill. I will leave it with the bitter melon auntie. She
is my wife’s mother.”</p>
<p>The connection snapped into place. The market network. “Oh.”</p>
<p>A faint smile. “Small island.” He gathered the tarp, folding it with
sharp, precise folds. “The tree will be tired. Don’t water it today. Let
it rest.”</p>
<p>And with that, they were gone, the cart wheels rumbling softly down
the alley. The backyard was silent again, but changed. The Tembusu stood
with its clean, open wound. The air still held the astringent scent of
the treatment solution, overlying the fading sweetness of the
flowers.</p>
<p>I felt charged, restless. The Botanic Gardens. The rain tree. It was
a destination, a purpose. I grabbed my bag, my wide-brimmed hat, and
left the house.</p>
<p>The Botanic Gardens were a shock of curated green. After the tight,
vertical lines of the shophouses and the concrete yard, the sprawl of
lawn, the towering canopy, the sheer <em>volume</em> of life was
overwhelming. I followed the signs to Swan Lake, a placid sheet of water
with an island of palms in its centre. And there, on a gentle slope
overlooking the water, was the rain tree.</p>
<p>It was a giant. Its canopy spread like a vast, green thunderhead,
casting a pool of deep, cool shade that must have been fifty metres
across. Its trunk was massive, buttressed with great, sinuous roots that
flowed out of the ground like molten rock frozen in mid-pour. It was the
opposite of the confined Tembusu. This was a tree of empire, of space,
of unquestioned belonging.</p>
<p>I sat on a bench in its shade. The temperature dropped noticeably.
The frantic drawings in the sketchbook came back to me—the scribbled
roots, the explosive energy. Seeing this tree, I understood the impulse.
This was not a passive thing. It was a conquest of light and space.</p>
<p>“Magnificent, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>An elderly man sat down on the far end of the bench. He was European,
white-haired, dressed in a crisp, short-sleeved shirt and trousers. He
held a walking stick with a silver handle.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“Planted in 1879,” he said, his accent British, old-school. “By the
Director, Henry Murton. A gift from the Calcutta Botanic Gardens.” He
recited it like a well-loved poem. “It has witnessed the whole parade.
Colonial officials, Japanese occupation, independence, tourists with
selfie sticks.” He chuckled. “A silent witness. The best kind.”</p>
<p>I looked at the tree’s vast, wrinkled bark. A silent witness. But Kai
Lim would say it was more. It was a living participant, fighting for
light, shedding leaves, drawing water, writing its history in rings.</p>
<p>“Do you come here often?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Every day since I retired. Twenty years ago.” He smiled. “My wife is
buried here. In the cemetery on the other side of the park. I talk to
her, then I talk to the tree. The tree is often more listening.” He
leaned on his stick. “You are new.”</p>
<p>“Is it that obvious?”</p>
<p>“You are looking at the tree like it’s about to</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-4-1"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Singapore is a solid thing, but the silence that followed
the old man’s unfinished sentence was its own kind of weather. It hung
between us on the bench, thick and expectant. <em>You are looking at the
tree like it’s about to…</em> To speak? To move? To reveal a secret
written in the pattern of its leaves? He never finished. A mynah bird
landed on the path with a sharp, scolding cry, and he simply nodded, as
if the bird had completed his thought for him. He rose, leaning on his
silver-handled stick, and offered a vague, polite smile that belonged to
another century. “Enjoy the shade,” he said, and walked away, a slow,
deliberate figure dissolving into the green haze of the park.</p>
<p>I was left with the giant. Its roots were like the limbs of something
submerged, heaving themselves out of the earth for a single, held
breath. A silent witness, he’d called it. But the tree in my sketchbook,
Kai Lim’s tree, was screaming. I felt the dissonance like a pressure in
my inner ear. This quiet, monumental presence, and the frantic,
spiritual seeking it had ignited in a stranger decades ago, did not
align. There was a missing step. A catalyst.</p>
<p>Auntie Li, when I’d paid the rent, had mentioned a name, dropped it
like a spent match. “You ask about trees, you find Thorne. Crazy <em>ang
moh</em> in a shophouse near Sultan Mosque. He knows roots.” She’d waved
a dismissive hand. “But his mind is… tangled.”</p>
<p>I found the shophouse. It was tucked in a row of pastel buildings,
its five-foot way cluttered not with café tables but with terracotta
pots holding stunted, twisted bonsai. Their trunks were knotted, their
canopies tortured into miniature clouds. They were trees under duress.
The door was a heavy thing of dark, varnished wood, set with a pane of
frosted glass. No blue ceramic frog. I knocked.</p>
<p>The sound was swallowed by the ambient hum of the lane—the distant
call to prayer, the sizzle of a wok. I was about to turn when the door
opened a crack, revealing a slice of a face: pale, blue-eyed, framed by
unkempt grey hair. The eyes were not old. They were alarmingly clear,
the blue of a gas flame.</p>
<p>“You’re not the delivery,” the man said. His voice was dry, textured
like sandstone.</p>
<p>“Auntie Li sent me. I’m Leo. From the Tembusu shophouse.”</p>
<p>The eyes assessed me, moving from my face to the bag on my shoulder
where the sketchbook was stored. “Li.” He said the name as if tasting
something sour. “She thinks I need a keeper. Or you do.” He opened the
door wider. “Come in. The street has ears.”</p>
<p>The interior was not a home. It was a workshop, a cave, a brain made
physical. The air was cool and smelled of ozone, soldering iron, and the
damp, mineral scent of wet clay. The walls, where visible between
shelves, were lined with banks of humming electronics—rack-mounted
servers with flickering LEDs, oscilloscopes painting green sine waves on
dark screens. But woven through this nest of tech were organic things:
specimens of polished wood cross-sections, their rings like topographic
maps; fossils of fern and leaf pressed between glass; and everywhere,
more bonsai, their tiny forms perched on monitors and stacks of
books.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room stood a long, steel table. And on it, under
a dome of clear acrylic, was the artifact.</p>
<p>It was both less and more than I’d imagined. Not a jewel, but a dull,
greyish orb about the size of a mango, its surface matte and
non-reflective. It seemed to drink the light. Around it, on the steel,
was a careful arrangement of objects: a piece of raw crystal, a spool of
copper wire, a fresh frangipani blossom already browning at the edges,
and a small, bowl-shaped sensor that glowed with a soft, amber
pulse.</p>
<p>“You found the sketchbook,” Thorne said. It wasn’t a question. He
moved to the table, his gait stiff. He wore faded cargo trousers and a
shirt that had once been white. “Kai Lim was a friend. A brilliant,
doomed friend. He didn’t just draw trees. He listened to them.”</p>
<p>“He wrote about a key,” I said, my voice low in the sanctum-like
quiet. “A spiritual key.”</p>
<p>Thorne’s lips twitched. Not a smile. A spasm of old pain. “A key
implies a lock. A door. He was a romantic. I am a mechanic.” He tapped
the acrylic dome. “This is not a spiritual key. It is a temporal anchor.
A battery. A recording device. The civilization that made it… they
didn’t build cities. They grew them. They didn’t write history. They
<em>imbued</em> it, into living systems. They believed time was not a
river, but a tree. A single, branching reality. This…”</p>
<p>He lifted the dome. The air in the room seemed to tighten, to hum at
a frequency just below hearing. The amber pulse from the sensor bowl
quickened.</p>
<p>“This is a seed from that tree. A seed that records the state of the
world—the light, the magnetic fields, the quantum noise, the growth
patterns of the forest around it. It doesn’t store data. It stores
<em>echoes</em>. Kai called it the ‘Whispering Pod.’ He believed the
great trees—the Tembusu, the Rain Tree—were like… antennas. They could
tune into these echoes. He was trying to listen.”</p>
<p>He reached out, not touching the orb, but moving his hand in a slow
arc above it. The matte surface shimmered. From its core, light
emerged—not a beam, but a coalescence, like dust motes dancing in a
sunbeam. It formed shapes above the orb: three-dimensional, holographic
symbols that rotated slowly. They looked like a hybrid of organic
tendrils and crystalline geometry. One pulsed a soft, warning red.</p>
<p>“This,” Thorne said, pointing to the red symbol, “is a decay marker.
The echo is unstable. It was never meant to be dormant this long.
Interacting with it raw, as Kai tried to do… it’s like putting your ear
to a seashell that contains the roar of the primordial ocean. It can
overwrite you. Dissolve the boundary between now and then.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, his gas-flame eyes burning. “Kai didn’t go mad
because he was seeking spirits. He went mad because he opened a door in
his mind and a thousand years of compressed, living memory tried to
flood in. He was a sensitive. An antenna himself. He last came here,
raving about ‘the first map’ being in the roots of the Rain Tree. Then
he vanished.”</p>
<p>The pieces shifted, locking into a new, terrifying configuration. The
frantic sketches were not the cause of his search; they were the
symptom. The artifact was the cause. And Kai Lim had left a trail.</p>
<p>“Why show me this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because you’re here,” Thorne said simply. “And because the echo has
become active in the last 48 hours. It started when you arrived.
Coincidence is a story we tell when we don’t know the plot. You are now
part of the system. You need to understand the rules before it reads
<em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>He spent the next two hours teaching me. It was not a lesson in
mysticism, but in a brutal, alien physics. The holographic symbols were
an interface. The tendril-glyphs represented biological stability; the
geometric ones, temporal coordinates. The orb responded to proximity, to
bio-electric fields, to intention. He made me sit before it, hands flat
on the steel table, and breathe slowly.</p>
<p>“Don’t reach for it,” he instructed, his voice a calm monotone.
“That’s what Kai did. He tried to <em>grasp</em> the memory. You must
let it flow. Be the bench under the rain tree. Be the five-foot way. A
space for waiting.”</p>
<p>I tried. The orb’s presence was a weight on my senses. The
holographic symbols shifted as my breathing changed. A new glyph, like a
spiralling fern frond, glowed green. Thorne nodded. “Recognition. It
sees you as part of the local biome now. A neutral element.”</p>
<p>It was exhausting. The effort of being passive, of holding my own
consciousness like a wide, shallow bowl, left me drained. I was about to
ask for water when the entire room flickered.</p>
<p>The holograms died. The server LEDs blinked out. For three
heartbeats, we were in utter black silence, the kind that exists only
before the world begins. Then the emergency lights on the power strips
flicked on, casting monstrous shadows from the bonsai.</p>
<p>Thorne was already moving, his stiffness gone. “They’re here.” He
slammed the acrylic dome over the orb and snatched it from its cradle.
“The Chronos Guard. They think it’s a weapon. A key to controlling the
branch-points of time. They want to prune the tree to their liking.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” I hissed, grabbing my bag.</p>
<p>“Academics gone feral. Intelligence agencies. Cultists. A committee
of the damned.” He threw a small, hard drive into my hands. “Everything.
Kai’s notes, my analyses. The coordinates he deciphered for the first
map.” He shoved me towards a back door I hadn’t seen, concealed by a
drape of printed circuit boards. “Go to the Rain Tree. At the base of
the largest eastern root. There’s a hollow. Look with the orb. Not your
eyes.”</p>
<p>The front door exploded inward. Not with fire, but with a percussive
<em>thump</em> that felt wrong—a sound that suppressed other sound. Two
figures entered, silhouetted against the lane’s light. They wore dark,
non-reflective suits and smooth helmets with no visible seams. They
moved with a terrible, fluid synchronicity.</p>
<p>Thorne didn’t hesitate. He threw a handful of metallic powder from
his workbench into the air. As the lead agent raised a device that
looked like a streamlined hairdryer, Thorne touched a spark from a
modified lighter to the cloud.</p>
<p>The world turned white and silent. Not a bang, but a flash of actinic
light that etched everything in negative. A photonic charge. I was
blind. I felt Thorne’s hand on my back, shoving me through the curtain
of circuits.</p>
<p>I stumbled into a narrow, wet alley. The sound rushed back in—the
distant traffic, my own ragged breath. Thorne followed, clutching the
orb under his arm. “This way.”</p>
<p>We ran. The alley twisted behind rows of shophouses, a secret vein of
the city. My vision returned in blotches of colour. Behind us, I heard
the clean, efficient sound of pursuit—soft-soled boots on wet
asphalt.</p>
<p>We burst onto a slightly larger street. A delivery tricycle was
parked outside a closed tailor shop. Thorne ducked behind it, pulling me
down. He was breathing in short, pained gasps. In the dim light, I saw
the dark, spreading stain on his side. A flechette, or some silent
projectile, had found him in the flash.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he wheezed, pressing the cold acrylic dome into my hands.
The orb within felt warmer than it should. “They want a weapon. Kai
wanted enlightenment. Both are wrong. It’s a <em>record</em>. The last
testament of a world that chose to become one with its own timeline. The
map… it’s not to a place. It’s to a state. A moment of perfect
synchronization. Kai called it ‘The Canopy.’ Where all branches are
visible.”</p>
<p>He coughed, a wet, hollow sound. “You have to get there. Not for
power. For… for the witness. A silent witness is the best kind, the old
man said, yes? But a <em>recording</em> witness… that is something else.
That is a duty.”</p>
<p>The footsteps were close, methodical, splitting up to flank the alley
mouth.</p>
<p>“Go,” Thorne said, his voice firming with a final reserve of
strength. “To the tree. Let it see you. Then follow the echo.”</p>
<p>He pushed me away, towards a connecting alley. Then he stood up. He
did not run. He turned to face the mouth of our hiding place, holding up
his empty hands. A decoy. A sacrifice to the timeline.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>
<p>I didn’t look back. I heard a soft <em>phut</em> sound, and a grunt.
No cry. Just the impact of a body on the ground. The sound of a life of
tangled, brilliant thought meeting a very clean, very simple end.</p>
<p>The rain began again. Not a solid wall, but a steady, weeping
drizzle. It washed over me as I ran through the back-lanes of Kampong
Glam, the orb held tight to my chest. It was not a bruise-coloured
suitcase. It was a darker, heavier heart, containing a world’s
whisper.</p>
<p>I made it to the Botanic Gardens as the first grey light of dawn
diluted the night. The gates were open for the early walkers. I moved
like a ghost past the symphony stage, past the bandstand, towards the
lake. The rain had thinned to a mist. The world was monochrome.</p>
<p>The Rain Tree emerged from the haze, more vast and more silent than
ever. A giant holding its breath. The grass was soaking. I fell to my
knees at the base of the largest eastern root, where it flowed out from
the trunk like the limb of a leviathan. There was a hollow, dark with
damp and leaf-litter.</p>
<p>My hands were shaking. I placed the acrylic dome on the wet grass and
lifted the orb out. It was hot now, almost uncomfortably so. I held it
before the hollow, as Thorne had taught me. Not reaching. Being a space
for waiting.</p>
<p>The orb shimmered. The holographic light spilled forth, not in
symbols this time, but in a cascade of emerald and gold particles. They
flowed into the hollow, illuminating not an empty space, but a pattern.
Carved into the very wood of the living root, hidden by moss and time,
was a perfect, intricate circle filled with the same hybrid
glyphs—tendril and geometry.</p>
<p>The orb’s light mapped onto the carving. It activated.</p>
<p>The hollow did not open. The root did not move. But the <em>air</em>
within the carved circle deepened, darkened. It became a well, a tunnel.
And at its end, not a place, but a sensation: a profound, resonant hum,
the sound of deep earth and vast, patient growth. A scent of loam and
ozone and something like old, polished stone flooded out. It was the
echo, not of a memory, but of a <em>direction</em>.</p>
<p>The first map was not on paper. It was a door in the roots of a
witness tree.</p>
<p>A twig snapped behind me. I turned, clutching the orb to my
chest.</p>
<p>A woman stood ten feet away. She was dressed in the practical clothes
of a morning jogger, but her posture was all wrong—too still, too
balanced. Her eyes were on the orb, then on the still-glowing hollow in
the root. She did not look surprised. She looked like she had arrived at
an appointment.</p>
<p>“He showed you, then,” she said. Her voice was calm, Singaporean,
with no trace of exertion. “Dr. Thorne. Where is he?”</p>
<p>I said nothing. The glow from the root was fading. The connection was
breaking.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” she said, taking a slow step forward. She held
no weapon. She didn’t need one. Her certainty was a weapon. “The Chronos
Guard appreciates his life’s work. And yours, Mr. Tan. You’ve saved us a
great deal of time. Now, let’s discuss the next branch.”</p>
<p>She smiled. It was a professional, empty thing.</p>
<p>And the rain tree, the silent witness, its leaves heavy with morning
wet, began to drip, a slow, steady percussion on the earth below.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-5-1"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></h2>
<p>The mountains of central Vietnam were a different kind of rain. It
was a mist that lived in the air, a permanent exhalation of the jungle
that coated the skin and seeped into the seams of clothing. It turned
the world into a spectrum of green and grey, where the calls of unseen
birds were muffled and the ground was a soft, treacherous sponge. After
the hard angles and drumming downpours of Singapore, this felt less like
weather and more like a state of being. A waiting, but without the cover
of a five-foot way.</p>
<p>I had used Thorne’s resources, a series of encrypted transfers and a
name whispered over a secure line, to get here. A man with a face like
weathered teak and a jeep that smelled of diesel and damp chicken
feathers had left me at the end of a track that dissolved into ferns. He
had pointed a gnarled finger uphill, into the cloud, and said nothing.
The journey was a blur of airports and hushed conversations, a ghost
itinerary. I was a parcel being forwarded, postage due.</p>
<p>My suitcase was gone, replaced by a worn canvas pack Thorne had left
in a locker at Changi. In it: topographic maps, a water filter, a
high-grade headlamp, a multi-tool, and packets of a nutritional paste
that tasted of peanuts and regret. And the orb, wrapped in a square of
raw silk, nestled at the centre. It was quiet now. The hollow in the
rain tree had closed, its light extinguished. But the map it had
revealed was etched behind my eyes: a sequence of glyphs that correlated
not to a place on any modern map, but to a feeling—a specific
convergence of rock, water, and magnetic anomaly. The first branch.</p>
<p>The climb was not a climb in the heroic sense. It was a slow,
stubborn seep upwards. The path was a suggestion made by boar and boot,
vanishing for stretches under curtains of liana and sudden, slick
inclines. The air grew thinner, cooler, but never dry. My world
contracted to the next handhold, the next semi-solid patch of ground.
The jungle was a cathedral of dripping silence, a green vault where time
pooled. I was not an explorer. I was an intruder, a small, damp mammal
moving through the lungs of something vast and indifferent.</p>
<p>I stopped when the light began to leach from the mist, not into
darkness, but into a deeper, more profound grey. I made camp on a shelf
of rock, ate a paste-smeared cracker, and watched the cloud swallow the
valley below. The silence was not empty. It was layered: the drip from a
thousand leaves, the rustle of something in the canopy, the low,
sub-auditory hum of my own blood. I took out the orb. It was cool,
inert. I held it in my palm, not reaching, as Thorne had said. Being a
space.</p>
<p>For a long time, nothing. Then, a faint, internal warmth, like a
stone that has held the sun. A single glyph on its surface—the one that
looked like a root meeting a vein of quartz—glowed a soft, mossy green.
It pulsed, slow and patient, in time with my heartbeat. A compass, not
for north, but for resonance.</p>
<p>The next day, I followed that pulse. It led me off the animal trail,
into a choked ravine where a stream muttered over black rocks. The
glyph’s glow intensified. I waded upstream, the cold water biting
through my boots, the mist coiling on the surface like smoke. The ravine
walls tightened. The sound of the water changed, deepening from a
chatter to a low, resonant groan. The air grew thick with the smell of
wet stone and something else—ozone, the sharp, clean scent after
lightning.</p>
<p>The ravine ended in a curtain of waterfall, not tall but wide,
pouring over a lip of basalt into a frothing pool. The orb was hot in my
hand now, the glyph burning a steady, urgent green. This was the place.
But there was no door, no arch, no carved entrance. Just water and
rock.</p>
<p>I stood there, the spray coating me, feeling the fool. The woman from
the park, the one from the Chronos Guard with her professional smile,
would have had scanners, tools, a team to divert the water. I had a warm
rock and a backpack.</p>
<p><em>Not reaching. Being a space.</em></p>
<p>I found a relatively dry niche under an overhang, sat on the cold
stone, and waited. I watched the waterfall. I watched the patterns in
the mist. I let the percussion of the water fill the hollow places in my
mind. Hours may have passed. The light did not change.</p>
<p>And then I saw it. It wasn’t a shape, but a rhythm. The waterfall
fell in a consistent, heavy sheet, but in one spot, about chest-high,
there was a subtle, regular shudder—a brief, translucent thinning in the
cascade every seven seconds. A syncopation in the hydrography. A door
that was not a door, but a hesitation.</p>
<p>I didn’t think. Thinking would have talked me out of it. I shouldered
my pack, secured the orb in its inner pocket, and waded into the pool.
The current tugged at my legs. The water was paralyzingly cold. I pushed
through the outer spray, a thousand needling impacts, and stood before
the wall of falling water. The sound was all-consuming, a white roar
that vibrated in my teeth.</p>
<p>I counted. One. Two. Three.</p>
<p>On the seventh beat, I stepped forward, into the shudder.</p>
<p>The water struck my shoulders, my head, a crushing, cold weight. For
a second, there was only the roar and the flood. Then my foot found no
purchase—I was falling, not into water, but through air. I landed on
smooth, wet stone, stumbling forward into darkness. The roar was
instantly muted, replaced by the echo of dripping water and my own
ragged breaths.</p>
<p>I fumbled for my headlamp. The beam cut the black, a shaky column of
white.</p>
<p>I was in a tunnel. It was not natural. The walls were seamless, a
polished black stone that drank the light, but they were also… grown.
Rib-like structures arched overhead, not carved, but <em>formed</em>,
like the roots of a great tree fused with polished obsidian. It was
organic engineering. The air was still, cold, and carried that same
scent from the hollow in the rain tree: loam, ozone, old stone. And
beneath it, the profound, resonant hum. It was in the stone itself, a
vibration felt through the soles of my boots.</p>
<p>The tunnel descended. There were no forks, no choices. It simply went
down, a gentle, spiralling slope. The silence was absolute, save for the
drip of water and the hum. I felt like I was walking into an ear,
towards the source of a deep, fundamental note.</p>
<p>After a time I could not measure, the tunnel opened into a chamber.
My headlamp beam scattered, unable to find a far wall. The floor was
level, covered in a fine, grey dust. And in the centre of the vast
space, illuminated by a single, impossible shaft of greenish light that
fell from some unseen aperture high above, was the lock.</p>
<p>It was a sphere of the same root-and-stone material, twice my height,
suspended in the air by no mechanism I could see. Its surface was
covered in a tapestry of the hybrid glyphs, but they were not static.
They flowed, slowly, like sap in a living thing, rearranging themselves
in a languid, perpetual dance. Around the sphere, floating at various
heights, were nine smaller stones, each roughly the size of my fist,
each carved into a perfect, complex geometric shape: a dodecahedron, an
icosahedron, a shape with too many faces to name.</p>
<p>The message was clear. This was the test. The puzzle lock.</p>
<p>I approached, the dust puffing softly around my boots. The hum was
stronger here, a physical pressure in my chest. I unwrapped the orb. The
moment it was free of the silk, it reacted. Its own glyphs ignited,
casting a pool of emerald and gold light at my feet. The flowing glyphs
on the great sphere paused. Then, they began to move faster, swirling
into a new configuration.</p>
<p>I understood nothing. Thorne had taught me to feel, to wait, not to
solve geometric proofs in a dead language. Panic, cold and slick,
started to rise. I was a fraud in a sacred space.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes against the overwhelming sight. The hum filled me. I
thought of the rain tree, its patient witness. I thought of the
five-foot way, a space for waiting. I was not a scholar. I was a
listener.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and did not look at the sphere. I looked at the dust
on the floor. My light caught the faintest of impressions—not
footprints, but smooth, shallow grooves radiating from the sphere,
almost erased by time. Paths. I followed one with my eyes. It led to a
specific spot on the chamber floor, directly in line with one of the
floating geometric stones—the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>An idea, fragile as the dust, formed. This wasn’t about solving the
sphere. It was about alignment. About placing yourself in the right
relation to it.</p>
<p>I walked to the spot aligned with the dodecahedron. I held the orb
out before me. The sphere’s glyphs swirled again. One of them—a pattern
of interlocking triangles—glowed brightly and seemed to peel away from
the surface, projecting into the air before me. It hovered, a
holographic key.</p>
<p>I looked at the dodecahedron stone. Its faces, I now saw, were not
blank. Each had a tiny portion of a glyph. I reached out, my hand
trembling. The stone was warm. I turned it slowly in the air. It moved
with a gentle resistance, as if suspended in thick oil. I rotated it
until the fragments on its faces aligned, completing the projected
glyph.</p>
<p>There was a soft <em>click</em>, felt more than heard. The
dodecahedron stone floated gently down to rest on a small pedestal I
hadn’t noticed in the dust.</p>
<p>One down.</p>
<p>It took hours. It was a meditation of slow movement and deep
attention. I would stand in a spot suggested by the grooves in the dust,
or sometimes by a new, faint glow from the orb. A glyph would project
from the sphere. I would find the corresponding geometric stone—the
icosahedron, the complex star-shaped form—and turn it, painstakingly,
until the fragments matched. <em>Click</em>. Another stone would
settle.</p>
<p>My body ached from cold and stillness. My mind was empty of
everything but the pattern, the hum, the feel of the cool, living stone
under my fingers. There was no fear of the Chronos Guard, no grief for
Thorne, no anxiety about what lay ahead. There was only the lock, and my
role as its temporary, fragile key.</p>
<p>With the final <em>click</em>—a resonant note that hung in the
air—the last stone, a beautiful, sixty-faced monster of geometry,
settled onto its pedestal. The great sphere ceased its flow. All its
glyphs shone at once, a silent, brilliant explosion of green-gold light
that forced me to shield my eyes.</p>
<p>Then the light vanished. The sphere was dark. The hum stopped.</p>
<p>The silence was total, a vacuum.</p>
<p>Then, with a sound like a deep sigh, the sphere split along a seam I
had never seen. The two halves parted, not mechanically, but like a seed
pod opening. Within was not a chamber, but a doorway, filled with a
soft, pearlescent radiance.</p>
<p>The Echo Vault.</p>
<p>I stepped through.</p>
<p>The vault was small, circular, and utterly simple. The walls were the
same living stone, but here they glowed with their own gentle,
bioluminescent light. The air was warm and dry, smelling of parchment
and sandalwood. In the centre of the room, on a plain plinth of
unadorned wood, sat a single object.</p>
<p>It was not a jewel, a weapon, or a book. It was a lotus pod, made of
a dark, petrified wood. It was large, about the size of a human heart,
and its surface was pocked with dozens of sealed chambers.</p>
<p>I approached, my footsteps silent. There was no trap, no final
guardian. Just the pod on the plinth, and the humming silence returned,
softer now, a contented purr.</p>
<p>I reached out and touched it. The moment my fingers made contact, the
vault dissolved.</p>
<p>Not the physical vault. The stone walls remained. But my sight was
pulled inward, and a recording, not of sight and sound, but of direct
experience, unfolded within me.</p>
<p><em>I am a builder. My name is Kaelen of the Deep Root. We shaped the
world by listening to its song. We grew our cities from the bones of
mountains, guided rivers with a thought, wove light into solid form. We
called it the Sympathy. It was the art of resonant alignment—with stone,
with stream, with star. It was not magic. It was a deeper physics, a
conversation with the substance of creation.</em></p>
<p><em>The vision showed wonders: spires of living crystal that sang in
the wind, bridges of solidified dawn, archives where memory was stored
in the growth rings of ancient trees.</em></p>
<p><em>We grew proud. We stopped listening to the world’s song, and
began to impose our own. We sought not harmony, but mastery. We tuned
the deep leylines to our own frequency, to amplify our power, to build
higher, faster, further from the earth that bore us.</em></p>
<p><em>The vision shifted. The singing spires developed a discordant
whine. The living stone of the cities grew brittle, then porous. The
rivers we had guided turned sluggish, then toxic. A wasting sickness,
not of body, but of connection, spread among us. We were deafening
ourselves. The great Sympathy became a feedback scream, a weapon turned
inward.</em></p>
<p><em>I am among the last. We have sealed the great resonances,
scattered the keys, and turned our final art to forgetting. Our power
was our doom. It was a beautiful, terrible addiction. We broke the first
rule: to be a space for the song, not the singer.</em></p>
<p><em>The Echo Vaults do not hold our power. They hold our warning. The
path you seek is not one of reclamation. It is one of understanding. The
Chronos Guard, those who would hunt these keys, they hear only the echo
of the scream and think it a call to glory. They are the old sickness,
in a new form.</em></p>
<p><em>You who have solved the lock not with force, but with alignment,
you have taken the first step. The next will be harder. To find the
heart of the Sympathy is to face the choice we failed to make. To
listen, and then to walk away.</em></p>
<p>The experience faded, leaving me on my knees before the plinth, tears
cutting tracks through the dust on my face. I was not weeping from
sadness, but from a devastating, humbling clarity. Thorne had sought a
lost wonder. The woman in the park sought a weapon. I had found an
obituary for a godhood, and a mirror.</p>
<p>The petrified lotus pod sat inert. It was not a treasure to be taken.
It was the warning itself, delivered. Its job was done.</p>
<p>I stood on shaky legs. The vault’s soft light seemed dimmer. The hum
was a fading memory.</p>
<p>A new sound intruded. Faint, sharp, out of place. The crunch of
gravel, the scuff of a boot on stone. From the tunnel entrance.</p>
<p>They had found me. The Chronos Guard. They had not needed to solve
the lock. They had only needed to follow the one who could.</p>
<p>I looked at the empty plinth, then at the open sphere-doorway behind
me. No weapon. No secret exit. Just the recorded ghost of a dead
civilization, now living in my bones.</p>
<p>The footsteps grew closer, measured, unhurried. They knew I had
nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I turned to face the entrance, my back to the heart of the Sympathy’s
failure. The headlamp beam from the tunnel blinded me, cutting through
the vault’s dying glow. A figure stepped into the chamber, not the
jogger from the park, but a man in tactical gear. He held no weapon. His
certainty, like hers, was enough.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tan,” he said, his voice echoing in the stone space. “Thank you
for opening the door.”</p>
<p>I said nothing. The dust of the builders was on my hands, their
warning in my heart. I was a space, waiting. But now, I was waiting with
a secret too heavy to hold, and a choice I did not yet know how to
make.</p>
<p>The man smiled. It was the same professional, empty thing.</p>
<p>Outside, in the world of green and grey, the mountain mist continued
its endless, patient exhalation.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-6-1"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></h2>
<p>The light from the headlamp was a physical weight, pressing me back
against the cold plinth. It pinned me in the present, a specimen. The
man who had spoken—Vex, I would learn—stood inside his own personal sun,
a silhouette edged in the vault’s failing luminescence. His lack of a
weapon was more unnerving than a drawn gun. It meant the environment was
his weapon. I was a rat in his sealed maze.</p>
<p>“The key was never under the frog, was it, Mr. Tan?” Vex said. His
voice was dry, polished, like stone worn smooth by indifferent water.
“It was in the waiting.”</p>
<p>I kept my hands visible, empty. The dust of the Sympathy was a fine
grey powder on my skin. I could still feel the echo of their choice in
the hollow of my chest, a resonance like a struck bell damped by a hand.
It was not a power. It was a scar.</p>
<p>“I didn’t take anything,” I said. My own voice sounded thin, stripped
by the chamber’s acoustics.</p>
<p>“We know.” He took a step forward. Two more figures materialized from
the tunnel behind him, moving with a fluid, predatory silence. Their
gear was matte, absorbing the light. “You performed the authentication.
The system is now… receptive. That is the prize.”</p>
<p>He gestured, a small, economical flick of his fingers. One agent
moved left, the other right, flanking the chamber. They began scanning
the walls with devices that chirped softly, a sound like mechanical
crickets. Vex kept his gaze on me. I was the known variable, the fixed
point.</p>
<p>“You seek a wonder,” I said, the words from the memory-vision leaving
my lips of their own accord.</p>
<p>Vex’s smile did not change. “I seek a correction. History is a leaky
vessel, Mr. Tan. The Chronos Guard patches the holes. What you call
‘wonder’ is often just a particularly dangerous leak.”</p>
<p>The agent to my right, a woman with a severe blonde plait, stopped at
a section of wall. “Commander. Residual charge pattern here. Fading, but
distinct.”</p>
<p>“Trace it,” Vex said, not looking away from me. “He is the primer.
His presence, his… emotional signature, it has woken the circuitry. Now
we map it.”</p>
<p>The understanding was a cold trickle. I was not a thief to be caught.
I was a catalyst. A living key, already turned. The hum I’d felt, the
vision I’d endured—it had left a mark on the vault, and on me. They were
using me as a dowsing rod.</p>
<p>I thought of the plinth, now empty behind me. The petrified lotus pod
had been a message in a bottle. I had read it. Now the bottle itself was
signalling. I had to move. Not to escape—that seemed a childish
fantasy—but to become unpredictable. To stop being a fixed point.</p>
<p>I let my shoulders slump, a portrait of defeat. I took a half-step
sideways, as if my legs were weak, putting the plinth between Vex and
myself. The plinth was not large, but it was stone, and it was the only
thing in the room that had mattered.</p>
<p>“The choice they failed to make,” I murmured, as if to myself.</p>
<p>Vex’s head tilted a degree. “What was that?”</p>
<p>“They had a choice. The Sympathy. They could have grasped for
godhood. They chose to walk away.”</p>
<p>“A poetic failure,” Vex said. He took another step. The distance
between us was now ten feet of open stone. “Sentiment is the luxury of
the doomed. We do not have that luxury. The timeline is not a garden to
be admired. It is a structure to be maintained. Sometimes that requires
pruning.”</p>
<p>The agent on the left chimed in. “I’ve got a parallel stream here,
Commander. Fainter. Could be a secondary conduit.”</p>
<p>“Or a drain,” Vex said. “Follow it. Find the junction.”</p>
<p>This was my moment. Their attention was bifurcating, split between
the technological readouts and the philosophical captive. I was neither.
I was the space between.</p>
<p>I dropped.</p>
<p>Not away, but forward, rolling over the low plinth in a clumsy,
graceless motion. My shoulder hit the stone floor on the other side with
a jolt. The headlamp beam swept over, blinding, but I was already
scrambling, not for the tunnel—a gauntlet of them—but for the open
spherical doorway at the chamber’s rear.</p>
<p>“Stop him!” Vex’s command was not a shout, but a sharpened spike of
sound.</p>
<p>I plunged into the sphere. It was not a room, but a short, smooth
corridor that curved sharply downward. The light from the vault
vanished, replaced by a profound, velvet blackness. I ran blind, one
hand on the cool, seamless wall, my feet sliding on the incline. The
sounds behind me were muffled, then sharpened: boots on stone, a hissed
order.</p>
<p>The corridor ended abruptly. I stumbled out into another space,
smaller, domed. A faint, sourceless glow seeped from the material of the
walls themselves, revealing a circular chamber with three arched niches.
In each niche sat a plinth, identical to the first. Two were empty. On
the third rested another object.</p>
<p>It was not lotus pod. It was a sphere of what looked like smoked
glass, about the size of a clenched fist, suspended within a cradle of
twisted, coppery wire. Inside the glass, something moved—a slow,
swirling nebula of minuscule silver particles, like a galaxy dreaming in
a bottle.</p>
<p>I had no time for awe. This was the heart. The junction.</p>
<p>A shadow filled the corridor entrance. Vex.</p>
<p>I did the only thing I could think of. I reached for the sphere.</p>
<p>My fingers did not touch glass. They passed through it, as if through
a membrane of cool water. The sensation was not physical, but synaptic—a
sudden, violent connection, like grasping a live wire made of memory.
The silver particles flared.</p>
<p><em>Image: A vast, underground river of light, flowing through a
continent of stone. Three nodes along its length, glowing like hearts.
This chamber was one. The other two… coordinates imprinted themselves
not as maps, but as feelings. A deep, resonant cold. A crushing, silent
pressure.</em></p>
<p><em>Voice, not the Builder’s, but a chorus of them, whispering in
unison: “The triad must sing as one, or the song becomes a scream. The
alignment is not a key. It is a chord.”</em></p>
<p>Then, a simpler, more recent impression, layered over the ancient
one: frustration. Curiosity. A face, sharp-featured, dark eyes wide with
a fear that was not of capture, but of complicity. The impression of a
hand, <em>almost</em> touching this same sphere, then pulling back. A
name, thought with the weight of a prayer: <em>Kaela</em>.</p>
<p>The connection lasted a second. Two. It was not a vision to be
watched, but a data stream to be endured. It flooded my nervous system
and receded, leaving me gasping, my hand still plunged into the
non-glass.</p>
<p>Vex stood frozen in the archway, his professional calm fissured by
raw avarice. “Don’t!”</p>
<p>He lunged.</p>
<p>I pulled my hand free. The swirling silver particles within the
sphere coalesced, then pulsed.</p>
<p>A soundless wave of force emanated from the plinth. It did not throw
me back. It passed through me, a shudder that vibrated my teeth and made
the bones of my skull hum. But it <em>hit</em> Vex. It was as if the air
in front of him solidified. He struck it at full speed and rebounded,
crashing to the floor with a grunt of shock and pain.</p>
<p>The sphere’s glow died to a dim ember. The defensive pulse, triggered
by my unauthorized access, had cost it.</p>
<p>I stared at Vex, who was shaking his head, struggling to push himself
up. The two other agents appeared behind him, weapons now drawn—compact,
ugly things that gleamed dully.</p>
<p>“Non-lethal!” Vex snarled, clawing at the wall to stand. “He is still
the primer! Take him!”</p>
<p>I was cornered. The chamber had no other exit. The agents advanced,
their weapons raised. They would incapacitate me, then use my subdued
presence to milk this chamber, and the others, dry.</p>
<p>Then, from the corridor behind them, a new sound. A sharp, pneumatic
<em>hiss-thud</em>. One of the advancing agents jerked and collapsed. A
small, feathered dart protruded from the seam of his tactical vest.</p>
<p>The second agent spun. Another <em>hiss-thud</em>. He fell beside his
companion.</p>
<p>Vex turned, his movement pained but fluid, his own weapon appearing
in his hand from a thigh holster.</p>
<p>A figure stood in the corridor shadows. Slim, dressed in the same
matte tactical gear, but the hood was down. Dark, braided hair. Sharp
features. The face from the memory-impression.</p>
<p>“The song isn’t yours to conduct, Commander,” she said. Her voice was
low, taut as a wire.</p>
<p>“Kaela.” Vex spat the name. “Sentiment <em>is</em> a luxury. And
you’ve just bankrupted yourself.”</p>
<p>“I’m cashing in my chips.” Her weapon—a compact tranquilizer
pistol—was aimed at his centre mass. “The boy. Now. Or the next dose is
calibrated for your metabolism.”</p>
<p>They were five metres apart. A standoff in a tomb. I was the
treasure, volatile and useless.</p>
<p>“You think he’s a prophet?” Vex’s laugh was a dry crack. “He’s a
tuning fork. We can use him to stabilise fractures you cannot even
comprehend.”</p>
<p>“You stabilise nothing,” Kaela said. Her aim did not waver. “You
silence. There’s a difference.” Her eyes flicked to me, just for an
instant. “Can you move?”</p>
<p>I nodded, my throat tight.</p>
<p>“Then move. To me. Slowly.”</p>
<p>I stepped away from the plinth, my legs unsteady. I walked the
perimeter of the chamber, giving Vex a wide berth. His eyes tracked me,
calculating. I saw the moment he decided. The cost of losing the primer
outweighed the cost of losing a rogue agent. His finger tightened on the
trigger of his sidearm.</p>
<p>Kaela saw it too. She fired.</p>
<p>Vex fired.</p>
<p>The world dissolved into noise and movement. I threw myself flat.
Kaela’s dart grazed Vex’s arm as he twisted. His shot—a snapping,
electric sound—burnt a black scar into the wall where her head had been.
She was already moving, diving into the spherical corridor.</p>
<p>“Go!” she yelled at me.</p>
<p>I scrambled after her. A second shot from Vex sparked off the
corridor wall, filling the air with the smell of ozone and scorched
stone. Then we were around the curve, back in the main vault, sprinting
past the empty central plinth toward the tunnel entrance.</p>
<p>Shouts echoed behind us, not Vex’s—he would be pursuing—but others.
Reinforcements in the tunnels.</p>
<p>Kaela grabbed my arm at the vault entrance, her grip iron. “Not that
way. They’ll have it sealed.” She pointed to the left wall of the vault,
to a section of intricate carvings I had taken for mere decoration. She
pressed a sequence of raised glyphs. With a deep, grinding groan, a
section of stone slid inward, then sideways, revealing a narrow, dark
shaft smelling of damp earth and root. A forgotten escape route, or a
builder’s passage.</p>
<p>“Down,” she ordered.</p>
<p>We descended a ladder of metal rungs set into the stone. She pulled a
lever inside; the door above us slid shut, plunging us into absolute
blackness. A small penlight clicked on in her hand. The beam showed a
rough-hewn tunnel, sloping steeply downward.</p>
<p>We did not speak. We climbed down, and down, for what felt like
years. The only sounds were our ragged breathing, the scuff of our
shoes, and the distant, fading vibration of the mountain above us—the
sound of a hive stirred to anger.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tunnel ended in a grate, half-hidden by the dripping roots of a
giant fig tree. We emerged into the shocking green wetness of the
rainforest, far down the mountain slope from the temple complex. The
afternoon mist was a tangible presence, swallowing sound and distance.
It was the same mist, the same patient exhalation, but it felt different
now. It was no longer a blanket of mystery. It was a veil of sanctuary,
however temporary.</p>
<p>Kaela leaned against the mossy tree trunk, closing her eyes,
listening. After a full minute, she let out a long, controlled breath.
“They’ll sweep the perimeter. But this… this is outside their primary
search grid. For now.”</p>
<p>I looked at her. In the diffuse green light, she looked younger than
her voice suggested, but her eyes were ancient with fatigue and resolve.
“Why?” was all I could manage.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. They were the colour of dark tea. “Because I
joined to mend time, not to muzzle it. Vex believes any anomaly is a
disease. I started to believe some anomalies might be… symptoms. Of a
deeper sickness in the timeline itself. The Sympathy isn’t a leak. It’s
a diagnosis.”</p>
<p>She pushed off from the tree. “We can’t stay. They’ll use drones once
the ground search fails. We need to get to the city.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“You have the imprint,” she said, starting to walk along a faint
animal trail. “The vault’s core message. I felt the secondary resonance
when you triggered the sphere. I’ve been monitoring the site for weeks,
trying to access it without… without being you. I couldn’t. You’re the
first viable primer we’ve found in decades.”</p>
<p>I followed, my mind a jumble of visions, gunshots, and echoing
whispers. “It showed me two other places. Feelings, not locations.”</p>
<p>“That’s how their technology works,” she said, ducking under a
low-hanging vine. “Cognitive cartography. The data is keyed to lived
experience, to emotional and sensory states. It’s why the Guard could
never brute-force it. You can’t torture a feeling from a machine.” She
glanced back at me. “What did you feel?”</p>
<p>I thought of the impressions. “One was… a deep, resonant cold. Not
just winter. Something older. The cold of a place that has never been
warm.”</p>
<p>Kaela nodded, her expression grim. “The second?”</p>
<p>“A crushing, silent pressure. The opposite of a mountain. A…
depth.”</p>
<p>She stopped, turning to face me. The mist curled between us. “I can
translate feelings to coordinates. The Cold—that’s a high-altitude
glacial lake in the Tian Shan mountains. A place of extreme stillness.
The Pressure…” She hesitated. “The Mariana Trench. The deepest point on
the planet.”</p>
<p>A glacial lake. An ocean trench. And a mountain vault. A triad.</p>
<p>“They have to be activated together,” I said, remembering the chorus.
“A chord. Not a key.”</p>
<p>“A synchronised resonance,” she whispered, awe cutting through her
tension. “Not to unlock a power, but to… to broadcast something. The
Sympathy’s final message. Their choice.” She began walking again, faster
now. “Vex will have parsed some of this from the residual data. He’ll
know the other nodes exist. He won’t know the synchronisation
requirement, not yet. He’ll try to secure them, to control the
broadcast. We have to get there first.”</p>
<p>“To do what?” I asked, the scale of it drowning me. “To play a chord
for a dead civilization? What does that <em>do</em>?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said, and there was a terrifying honesty in it.
“But I know what Vex will do. He will try to turn it into a scalpel. To
cut out any part of history he deems… unruly. The Sympathy walked away
from that kind of power. The Guard would kneel before it.”</p>
<p>We reached a dirt road, little more than a track. An old, battered
Suzuki 4x4 was parked under a stand of bamboo, camouflaged with nets.
Kaela’s safe-fall vehicle.</p>
<p>As we drove, the mist thinning to a drizzle, the world began to
return. The smell of wet earth and petrol. The groan of the suspension.
The reality of what was happening settled onto my shoulders, a heavier
weight than any secret.</p>
<p>I was no longer Leo Tan, who waited under five-foot ways. I was a
primer, a component in a machine of unimaginable age. I had a rogue
agent as a guide, and a fanatic as a hunter. I had a chord to play
across the spine of the world.</p>
<p>Kaela broke the silence as the city’s first distant lights began to
smear the grey horizon. “We need resources. False IDs. Travel routes
they won’t predict. I have a contact. A forger. He operates out of a
kopitiam in Geylang. He’s… eccentric. But he’s the best, and he has no
love for the Guard.”</p>
<p>“Why would he help?”</p>
<p>“Because I saved his daughter from a… temporal eddy. A small one. A
loop that had her reliving the same hour of an exam for what felt like
weeks. He owes me.” She checked the mirrors, a constant, automatic tic.
“We’ll go tonight. It’s the only window we have.”</p>
<p>The rain began again, not a silver wall, but a steady, soaking
insistence. It washed the mountain dust from my hands, but not the
feeling. The choice of the Sympathy was not mine, not yet. But the
running was. The seeking was.</p>
<p>The forger’s name was Ravi, Kaela said. He asked no questions, and
told only lies that were more truthful than facts. He was our next step
into the unseen world.</p>
<p>As the city swallowed us, tower by tower, I watched the rain on the
windshield. Each drop traced a path, a potential route, before being
swept away by the wipers. We were like that. Moving on a glass we could
not see, pushed by forces we could not control, toward a destination
that was only a feeling of cold, and a memory of pressure.</p>
<p>The wait was over. Now came the walk.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-7-1"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Geylang was a different animal. It wasn’t a solid wall,
nor a steady insistence. It was a slick, oily shimmer on neon signs that
bled Chinese characters and dubious promises into the wet streets. It
clung to the steam rising from perpetual cookpots, a broth of humidity
and frying garlic, of sewage and jasmine incense. Our Suzuki, a
mud-spattered ghost from the mountains, looked alien here, a creature of
raw earth stranded in a circuit-board of desire.</p>
<p>Kaela parked in the lee of a repurposed shophouse, its ground floor a
roaring, fluorescent-lit mechanic’s bay. “He’s not in the kopitiam,” she
said, killing the engine. The sudden silence was filled by the thump of
bass from a nearby karaoke lounge. “He’s above it. The kopitiam is his…
listening post. His theatre.”</p>
<p>We slipped through a side door, up a narrow staircase that smelled of
stale grease and mildew. The sound of clinking cups and Hokkien chatter
rose from below. At the top, a door of reinforced steel, painted a
peeling, cheerful green. Kaela knocked a pattern: two quick, three slow,
one final, decisive rap.</p>
<p>The door opened on a sigh of cool, dehumidified air.</p>
<p>The room was a cavern of organised chaos. Banks of old radio
equipment hummed alongside flat screens streaming global news feeds,
sound muted. Maps papered the walls—not just geographical, but
topological, temporal charts with swirling, hand-drawn annotations of
supposed “currents” and “eddies.” In the centre, at a desk made from a
salvaged aircraft hatch, sat Ravi.</p>
<p>He was a small man, all sharp angles and watchful eyes behind thick,
magnifying lenses clipped to his spectacles. His hair was a wild grey
cloud. He didn’t look up from the passport he was ageing with a careful
application of tea and ash. “Kaela,” he said, his voice a dry rustle.
“The bill comes due, yes? You are the bill.”</p>
<p>“We need to disappear,” Kaela said, moving into the room as if she
owned its shadows. “Singapore, then international. Two sets. Deep
background.”</p>
<p>Ravi’s eyes flicked to me, a swift, appraising scan that felt less
like being seen and more like being indexed. “Him. The primer. The
Guard’s new favourite song.” He set down his brush. “They are not
subtle. Their nets are in the immigration databases, the facial
recognition queues at Changi. They pulse through the CCTV like a
heartbeat. To hide you is to argue with the city’s own eyes.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done harder,” Kaela said.</p>
<p>“For my daughter, I parted a small sea of time. For you?” He
shrugged, a bony, economical gesture. “I need a story. Not the truth. A
story so good it becomes a fact. Give me a thread.”</p>
<p>It was my turn. Kaela nodded, almost imperceptibly. I heard my own
voice, unfamiliar in this room of static and secrets. “We’re
researchers,” I said. “Maritime archaeologists. Surveying the drowned
sites in the Riau Archipelago. The University of Malaya. There’s a
grant.”</p>
<p>Ravi stared at me, unblinking. Then a smile, thin as a razor cut,
appeared on his face. “Boring. Competent. Forgivable.” He turned to his
screens, fingers flying across a keyboard. “The Guard looks for runners,
for spies, for thieves. They do not look for academics. Dullness is a
finer cloak than shadow.” He began to mutter, a stream of technical
incantation. “I will give you papers, visas, credit histories that will
yawn at border guards. You will have published bland articles. You will
have university email addresses that work.” He looked back at me. “But
the sea… it is not a lie, is it?”</p>
<p>Kaela answered for me. “No. It’s not.”</p>
<p>“Then your destination?”</p>
<p>“The Java Sea. North of the Karimunjawa islands.”</p>
<p>Ravi’s fingers stilled. For the first time, he seemed truly present,
the room’s hum receding. “The <em>Laut Teduh</em>,” he whispered. The
Quiet Sea. “Where the water drinks the sound and the compass forgets
north. You seek the second verse.”</p>
<p>The air left the room. Kaela’s hand went to the hilt of her blade.
“What do you know of verses, forger?”</p>
<p>He took off his magnifying lenses, his eyes small and piercing. “I
listen. That is my currency. I hear the white noise of the world, and
sometimes, a pattern sings through. The Guard mobilises not for one
rogue, but for a sequence. A priming. They chatter in codes about
‘stanzas’ and ‘restorations.’” He leaned forward. “You go to the sunken
city. The one that is not on any chart, because charts are made by men
who see only the surface.”</p>
<p>“And if we are?” I asked, the weight of the choice settling
again.</p>
<p>“Then your dull archaeologist cover is a good one. And you will need
more than false papers.” He swivelled to a rusted filing cabinet,
pulling out a tube. Inside was a chart, but not like his others. This
was older, vellum, with depths marked in <em>depa</em>—the fathom of a
man’s outstretched arms. In its centre, a void labelled only
<em>Teduh</em>. “My grandfather was a fisherman. He spoke of a place
where his nets would come up hot, even in the cold deep. Where
sometimes, his echo-sounder would show great, straight lines, then
nothing. He called it the City of Drowned Light. He said on still
nights, you could hear its bells.” Ravi handed me the tube. “A story for
a story. Now we are even.”</p>
<p>The transaction was complete. We left with new names in our pockets,
and an old map in my hand. The rain had softened to a drizzle. In the
Suzuki, the world felt both larger and more narrow. The Guard was a net,
but the unseen world had its own currents, and we were being pulled into
the deep.</p>
<hr />
<p>We left Singapore under our new names on a rust-streaked survey
vessel, the <em>Kijang</em>. It was a floating museum of diesel fumes
and corroded metal, chartered by our bland, fictional university
department. To the crew, we were Dr. Tan and Dr. Sari, politely obsessed
with silt samples and sonar anomalies. We kept to our small cabin, its
porthole a greasy eye on the churning, green-brown water of the
Singapore Strait.</p>
<p>Kaela spent hours cross-referencing Ravi’s chart with the coordinates
she had carried in her head. “The Guard knows the general region,” she
said one night, the cabin lit by the glow of her tablet. The engine’s
vibration was a constant toothache in the bones. “They’ll have watchers
on the conventional dive sites, the known wrecks. But the <em>Laut
Teduh</em>… it sits in a fold. A geomagnetic blind spot. The seafloor
there is unstable, volcanic. It makes their instruments dream.”</p>
<p>“How did the Echo build in such a place?” I asked, watching the
moonlight fracture on the water outside.</p>
<p>“They didn’t build <em>in</em> it,” she said, not looking up. “They
built <em>with</em> it. Their cities weren’t placed. They were grown, or
woven, into the fabric of a location. A sunken city wasn’t a tragedy for
them. It was a different phase of the symphony. The vault here won’t be
a chamber. It will be a component.”</p>
<p>After two days, the water shifted from silted green to a deep, clear
indigo. The air lost the land-smell. On the third morning, the captain,
a taciturn Javanese man with salt-cracked lips, pointed ahead. “<em>Laut
Teduh</em>,” he grunted. “Water is strange. Fish are few. We drop you
here. You have eight hours.”</p>
<p>The quiet was the first thing I noticed. The ship’s noises seemed
muffled, swallowed. The sea was a flat, breathless pane of glass,
reflecting a bleached sky. No birds cried. It was an eerie, waiting
silence.</p>
<p>We kitted up in our dive gear—professional, unremarkable. Kaela
secured a watertight case to her belt. Inside, the primer. As I checked
my gauges, a memory surfaced, unbidden. A story from my own past, a
thread that seemed to tremble now against Ravi’s map.</p>
<p>“My grandfather,” I said, the words quiet in the heavy air. “Not the
one who told me of the Guard. The other one. My mother’s father. He was
a <em>wayang kulit</em> puppeteer in Melaka.”</p>
<p>Kaela paused, her hands on her weight belt.</p>
<p>“He had one story he never performed for crowds. Only for family, on
certain nights. The story of <em>Raja Segara</em>, the King of the Sea.
Not a god, but a man who learned the secret language of the deep. In the
tale, the king built a palace not of stone, but of ‘frozen song,’ with
pillars that were ‘tuned to the moon’s pull.’ He said the symbols of
this palace were passed down, hidden in the patterns of <em>batik</em>
and the movements of the <em>silat</em> dance.” I met her gaze. “He drew
one for me once, in the dust of his workshop. A spiral, with a line
cutting through its centre. He called it the ‘Anchor of the Tides.’ I
saw that symbol, Kaela. In the first vault. On the archway.”</p>
<p>Her expression didn’t change, but her stillness deepened. “Family
legends are often the echo of an echo. A truth wrapped in parable,
surviving where plain history burns.” She handed me a regulator. “The
Guard believes the Sympathy is a technology to be controlled. Your
grandfather’s story… it suggests it was an art to be understood. A
language. That changes the nature of the choice, Leo.”</p>
<p>It did. It wasn’t just about power, or preventing a fanatic from
wielding it. It was about comprehension. About hearing a song so old it
had become geology. The spiritual seeking wasn’t just in the
destination, but in the lineage. My waiting under five-foot ways, my
grandfather’s dust-drawn symbols—they were all part of the same, long
hesitation before a note is played.</p>
<p>We rolled backwards into the water.</p>
<p>The silence became absolute, broken only by the roar of my own
breath. We descended through a column of fading light into a cool, blue
twilight. The seafloor here was not the smooth abyssal plain I expected.
It was a jagged landscape of black basalt pillars and deep, razor-cut
crevasses, like a city shattered by giants and then drowned.</p>
<p>Kaela led, following a handheld sonar unit that painted a ghostly
image of the terrain. We swam through canyons, over ridges. And then,
the world changed.</p>
<p>The basalt gave way to shape. Not ruins, not in the human sense.
There were no collapsed walls, no tumbled columns. Instead, the living
rock had been… guided. Curved into great, flowing buttresses that swept
up from the seafloor. Smooth, organic arches spanned chasms. It was
architecture as reef, as natural formation, but with a profound,
unsettling geometry. The scale was vast, humbling. We were insects
swimming through the skeletal cathedral of a leviathan.</p>
<p>And there, at the heart of it, was the machine.</p>
<p>It was a mound, a gentle rise in the seafloor, perhaps a hundred
metres across. But its surface was a mosaic of interlocking plates, like
the carapace of a cosmic beetle. Each plate was inscribed with the
now-familiar Echo script, glowing with a faint, bioluminescent blue, a
cold fire that pulsed in a slow, tidal rhythm. At its crest, a single,
seamless dome of the same material.</p>
<p>This was no hidden chamber. This was an engine. A dormant heart.</p>
<p>We landed on the carapace beside the dome. Close up, the script
swirled and coiled, alive with the slow dance of deep-sea currents.
Kaela unsealed the case. The primer, in this submerged, ancient place,
began to hum, a vibration I felt in my teeth. The blue light on the
machine brightened in response, threads of radiance converging towards
us.</p>
<p>At the base of the dome, a panel had slid open, revealing a
depression. Its shape was not for a hand, or a key. It was a complex,
geometric socket.</p>
<p>Kaela examined it, her dive light tracing its contours. She then
turned her light to me, making a series of swift, sharp hand signals.
<em>Requires energy source. Modern. High-yield. To wake the
system.</em></p>
<p>I understood. The first vault required a blood-price, a genetic key.
This one demanded a fuel. A sacrifice of our time to awaken theirs.</p>
<p>She pointed to my left side, to the small, hard-case pod strapped to
my thigh. My escape pod. Inside was everything I’d kept from my old life
that had any practical use: currency, a multi-tool, a fire starter, a
miniature water purifier, painkillers, a folding knife. The curated
remnants of a man who believed in preparedness. It was powered by a
compact, military-grade lithium cell, enough to run a small device for a
year. Or to send a distress beacon screaming across a hundred miles.</p>
<p>I looked at the socket. I looked at the pod. The choice was a cold,
hard knot in my gut.</p>
<p>This was the walk. Not through rain, but through the consequences of
seeking. To progress, I had to surrender my last tangible link to
self-reliance, to the practical world of problems solved with tools and
power cells. I would be giving up my final insurance policy, placing my
survival entirely into the hands of this ancient machine and the rogue
agent beside me.</p>
<p>Kaela watched, her bubbles rising in a patient stream. She offered no
counsel. This was the primer’s choice.</p>
<p>I unstrapped the pod. It felt absurdly light, a trivial thing against
the monumental, sleeping weight of the machine. I turned it over, found
the release for the power cell. With a click, it came free, a smooth
black rectangle. The pod itself, now inert, was just a plastic shell. I
let it drift from my fingers, into the dark water beside the carapace.
It vanished quickly, a piece of my old life consumed by the deep.</p>
<p>I slotted the power cell into the socket.</p>
<p>It fit perfectly.</p>
<p>For a moment, nothing. Then, a sound. A deep, sub-audible
<em>thrum</em> that travelled through the water and up my spine. The
bioluminescent script flared, a wave of brilliant blue-white light that
raced out from the dome across the entire machine, illuminating the
colossal, coiled form of it in the abyssal gloom. The plates of the
carapace began to shift, infinitesimally, with a grinding groan of stone
on stone that echoed through the water.</p>
<p>The dome irised open.</p>
<p>Inside was not a room, but a nexus. A single, central plinth of
crystal, and from it, radiating in three dimensions, lines of
light—holographic, or something stranger—threads that connected to
points on the inner dome, depicting a star map, or a schematic of
impossible complexity. At the plinth’s heart, suspended in the crystal,
was the second verse.</p>
<p>It was not a disc. It was a sphere, a tiny, perfect orb of the same
resonant material. It pulsed with a soft, inner light, in time with the
great machine’s glow.</p>
<p>Kaela swam forward, reverent, and carefully retrieved it. As her
fingers closed around it, the entire light-show flickered. The schematic
in the dome shifted, the lines reconfiguring, pointing… elsewhere. A
third location. The image resolved into a familiar shape: a mountain
range, but one rendered with stark, symbolic clarity. A single,
double-peaked summit.</p>
<p>A chime sounded in our comms units—the pre-set warning. Two hours of
air left. The machine’s light was already fading, the plates settling
back into dormancy. Its brief awakening was over, my power cell
spent.</p>
<p>We ascended through the darkening water, the sphere a secret sun in
Kaela’s case. On the surface, hauling ourselves back into the world of
air and noise onto the <em>Kijang</em>’s deck, the transition was
violent. The silence of the deep was replaced by the ship’s racket, the
sun was a brutal hammer on my eyes.</p>
<p>In our cabin, dripping saltwater, we stared at the sphere. The third
location was clear. The Double Peaks of Tawangmangu, in Central Java. A
place of mist and volcanoes and ancient Hindu-Buddhist temples.</p>
<p>But as Kaela downloaded the navigational data from her dive computer,
her face tightened. “The Guard’s net,” she said, her voice flat. “They
couldn’t pinpoint the <em>Laut Teduh</em>, but they triangulated the
energy spike. The primer’s signature, the machine’s awakening. It was a
beacon.” She turned the screen to me. It showed a satellite overlay of
our position. Two fast-moving contacts, sleek, unmarked cutter-style
ships, were converging on our coordinates from north and south. An hour
away, maybe less.</p>
<p>“They’re not waiting at the next site,” she said. “They’re coming for
the primer itself.”</p>
<p>The captain’s voice barked over the intercom, panicked. Unidentified
vessels on radar. Demanding we heave to.</p>
<p>The walk had brought us to the vault. Now it had brought the hunters
to our heels. We had the second verse, and the key to the third. But the
symphony was turning into a chase, and the next movement would be
written in the cold, hard language of pursuit and capture, under a sky
that no longer felt like a refuge, but like the lid of a closing
trap.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-8-1"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></h2>
<p>The silence of the deep had been a cathedral. The silence inside the
second vault was a tomb. It was the difference between held breath and
the absence of any breath at all. We stood on a ledge of fused black
stone, the sphere’s light now a low, sullen ember in Kaela’s hands,
illuminating a chamber that drank sound and light with equal thirst. The
air was cool, sterile, tasting of ancient dust and ozone, a flavour that
lingered at the back of the throat like a memory of lightning. The walls
were not carved but seemed to have been grown, flowing into arches and
niches with the organic logic of a honeycomb or a coral reef. In the
centre of the chamber, a pedestal of the same seamless material rose
from the floor, its top a shallow bowl, waiting.</p>
<p>The <em>Kijang</em> was a world away, a tin can of panic on a
tightening sea. The captain’s last transmission had been a static-laced
garble. The cutter ships were closing, their profiles on the radar like
knife-blades slicing through water. We had maybe forty minutes. The math
was simple, brutal. Get the verse, get out, vanish into the
archipelago’s thousand veins before the trap shut.</p>
<p>“It feels like a throat,” Kaela whispered. Her voice, usually so
solid, was absorbed by the walls, leaving only the ghost of the
words.</p>
<p>I placed the primer in the bowl. It was not a fit, but a recognition.
The material of the pedestal softened, flowed upwards in a slow, viscous
wave, and encased the sphere to its midpoint. The light within it pulsed
once, deeply, a heartbeat felt in the bones more than seen by the eyes.
Then the chamber awoke.</p>
<p>Light did not flood in. It unfolded. It emerged from the walls
themselves, a soft, sourceless bioluminescence that painted everything
in shades of blue and grey. The walls were not blank. They were covered
in a flowing script, the same language as the primer, but here it moved.
Not like a screen, but like water moving over stone, the characters
swirling, recombining, telling their story in a river of glyphs. The air
thickened, humming with a sub-audible frequency that vibrated in my
teeth.</p>
<p>“It’s a playback,” Kaela said, her face tilted up, reflecting the
soft dance of light. “A memory of the place.”</p>
<p>But it was more than a memory. The hum deepened, tuned itself to the
resonance in my skull—the same frequency that had guided me, the walk
that was a listening. The moving script on the walls blurred. The
chamber dissolved. Not into darkness, but into a <em>then</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The vision did not arrive as images. It arrived as senses. I was
there, and I was not.</p>
<p><em>The sky is a bruised peach, streaked with green. The air is warm,
thick with the scent of blooming something—a heavy, cloying perfume that
speaks of growth and ripeness. I stand in a city that makes Singapore’s
towers look like child’s blocks. Spires of crystalline rock curve
towards the sky, not defying gravity but dancing with it. Walkways of
light thread between them, and on them, people move. They are tall,
graceful, their forms suggested more by light and shadow than by solid
flesh. There is no sound of engines, only a low, harmonious tone, the
city itself singing a single, sustained note of peace. This is the
height. This is the day before the fall.</em></p>
<p><em>The tone changes. A dissonance. A hunger. It starts in the
centre, where a great spire, pulsing with a gentle gold light, begins to
throb. The pulse is arrhythmic, greedy. The harmonious tone fractures
into competing frequencies. I feel the shift not as sight, but as a
nausea in the spirit. They are not just drawing power from the earth’s
song anymore. They are amplifying it. Twisting it. They have found the
core melody, the primal frequency, and they are feeding it back into
itself, a feedback loop of creation, seeking not balance, not
understanding, but dominion. They call it the Grand Unison.</em></p>
<p><em>The sky darkens from peach to liver-purple. The green streaks
ignite into sickly phosphorescence. The earth’s song, always there
beneath everything, becomes a scream. The crystalline spires do not
crack; they shiver, their molecular harmony disrupted. They begin to
dissolve from the bottom up, not into rubble, but into a fine, singing
sand that pours downwards in silent, beautiful waterfalls. The people on
the walkways do not run. They stop. They look up as the sky tears. They
open their mouths, not in screams, but as if trying to taste the
changing air. Their forms flicker, static on a screen, and then they are
simply… not. Unmade. Not by fire or impact, but by the unraveling of the
frequency that held them in being. The world is not destroyed. It is
de-tuned. The great spire of gold light goes black. Then, it erupts. Not
with fire, but with silence. A wave of absolute, annihilating quiet
rolls out, and where it passes, the song of the world stops. Stone,
light, life—all reduced to a neutral, silent state. Ash without heat.
The cataclysm is not an explosion. It is a cancellation.</em></p>
<p><em>The last thing I perceive is not from the dying city, but from
the edges. A handful of figures, their light dimmed, fleeing into deep
places. Carrying with them seeds. And a warning, etched not in stone,
but in the residual ache of the world’s wronged song: THE WALK IS FOR
LISTENING. THE SONG IS NOT A TOOL. TO FORCE THE UNISON IS TO INVITE THE
SILENCE.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I came back to myself on my knees. The chamber’s soft light was
searing. I was gasping, my hands pressed to the cold floor, vomiting
nothing but dry, heaving breaths. The taste of that cloying perfume was
in my mouth, the echo of the silent scream in my inner ear. Kaela was
beside me, her hand on my shoulder, her face pale.</p>
<p>“Leo. <em>Leo</em>.”</p>
<p>“They didn’t lose it,” I choked out. “They broke it. They tried to
play the conductor and blew out the orchestra. The power we’re
following… it’s the scar tissue. It’s what’s left after they tried to
turn a prayer into a weapon.”</p>
<p>Her grip tightened. The practical mind reasserting itself over the
horror. “Then the final vault…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t a prize. It’s the source of the wound. The control point for
the Grand Unison.” I looked at the pedestal. The primer’s light was
steady now, and a new set of glyphs, final and severe, were etched into
the air above it. The second verse. The warning.</p>
<p>Kaela was already moving, her dive computer’s camera capturing the
hovering glyphs. “We have it. Now we go. We have to beat Vex to the
third site, seal it, bury it—”</p>
<p>The chamber’s hum shifted pitch. It was no longer the deep,
remembering tone. It was the alert shriek of a tripped wire. The light
turned a harsh, antiseptic white.</p>
<p>“He’s not waiting for the third site,” a voice said, its timbre
smooth, amplified, and utterly out of place in the ancient air.</p>
<p>From the entrance tunnel, shadows resolved into figures. They moved
with a trained, fluid silence, clad in matte-black tactical gear,
weapons not raised but held ready. And between them, moving as if he
owned the silence, was a man in a grey linen suit, untouched by the sea
or the climb. Vex. His hair was silver, cut close, his face a study in
intelligent calm. He held a small, rectangular device—a field resonator,
tuned to disrupt the vault’s harmonics. It was the source of the harsh
white light.</p>
<p>“He’s here for the primer,” I said, the words ash in my mouth.</p>
<p>Vex smiled. It was a small, polite thing. “Mr. Tan. Ms. Sari. You’ve
saved me considerable time. And you,” he said, his eyes settling on me,
“have confirmed the hypothesis. The vision. Quite a thing, isn’t it? The
folly of god-kings who lacked conviction.”</p>
<p>Kaela moved, a blur of instinct, snatching the primer from the
pedestal. The chamber groaned. Two of Vex’s men were on her before she
took a step. They were efficient, brutal. A strike to the brachial
plexus. Her arm went numb. The sphere clattered on the stone. It did not
break. It rolled, coming to rest at Vex’s polished shoes.</p>
<p>He bent and picked it up, cradling it with a scholar’s care. “Thank
you.”</p>
<p>“You saw the same vision,” I said, pushing myself to my feet. My legs
felt like water. “You know what it did. What it <em>is</em>.”</p>
<p>“I saw a failure of nerve,” Vex corrected, his voice a lecturer’s
drone. “They grasped the fundamental frequency of reality—the source
code of creation—and when it began to buck, they panicked. They tried to
shut it down. A clumsy, catastrophic abort.” He stepped closer, his eyes
bright with a fervent, icy light. “They were composers who feared their
own symphony. The Grand Unison isn’t a cataclysm, Mr. Tan. It is a
reset. A return to a blank slate, upon which a new, ordered world can be
written. One without the noise, the chaos, the stubborn, singing mess of
humanity. The Silence they feared is the necessary pause before the
perfect note.”</p>
<p>He was insane. Not with rage, but with a clean, logical insanity that
was far more terrifying.</p>
<p>“You want to trigger it,” Kaela spat, held firmly between the
guards.</p>
<p>“Control it,” Vex said. “Channel it. The old world ended because the
process was runaway, undirected. The primer and the final vault are the
regulator. With them, the Unison can be focused. Surgical. A scalpel,
not a bomb. Imagine it. A frequency that can unmake a city, a
government, a rebellious thought, at its source. Not with bullets, but
with a… correction. The ultimate peace.”</p>
<p>“You’ll kill millions,” I said.</p>
<p>“I will silence the cacophony,” he replied. “And from that silence,
build a world that <em>makes sense</em>.” He looked at the primer in his
hand. “You found the walk. You listened. But you misunderstood the song.
It is not a lullaby. It is a command.”</p>
<p>He nodded to his men. They forced Kaela towards the tunnel. She
fought, silent, fierce, her eyes finding mine. They weren’t pleading.
They were instructing. <em>Do something.</em></p>
<p>I lunged. Not for Vex, but for the nearest guard, for his weapon. I
was slow, clumsy, still unmoored from the vision. A blow caught me on
the temple. The world flashed white, then grey. I hit the floor, the
taste of blood and ancient dust filling my mouth.</p>
<p>Vex looked down at me, a faint disappointment in his gaze, like a
tutor watching a promising student fail a simple test. “You have a gift,
Mr. Tan. A sensitivity. It’s a pity you chose to wander, instead of to
lead.” He turned to leave, then paused. “The surface team reports your
ship is… compliant. We’ll be taking Ms. Sari. Her expertise on the
geological triggers will be useful at Tawangmangu. You, however… this
place is a fitting end for a walker. A tomb for a listener.”</p>
<p>He made a small gesture. One of his men placed a compact charge on
the pedestal, then another at the entrance tunnel. “The sea will do the
rest. More elegant than a bullet.”</p>
<p>They left, taking the light, taking Kaela, taking the sphere. The
harsh white glare from Vex’s device vanished, plunging the chamber back
into its own soft bioluminescence. I heard their footsteps recede. Then,
a deep, shuddering <em>crump</em> from the tunnel entrance. The sound of
stone fracturing. A second later, a low, groaning roar began, the sound
of water finding a new path.</p>
<p>The chamber was flooding.</p>
<hr />
<p>The water did not rush in. It arrived. A solid, black tongue licking
from the entrance tunnel, swallowing the light as it came. It was cold,
a shock that cleared the fog from my head even as it promised a deeper
oblivion. The math was simple again. The chamber was a sealed bowl. The
entrance was the only pipe. That pipe was now clogged with rubble and
filling fast. I had minutes, maybe less.</p>
<p>Panic was a luxury. The vision had left a residue, a map of
desperation in my mind. I pushed myself up, slipping on the wet stone.
The water was already ankle-deep, chillingly intimate. I looked at the
pedestal. The charge on it was a small, blinking eye of red light. It
would go last, ensuring the central mechanism was destroyed. The final
verse, the warning glyphs, were gone, absorbed back into the walls.</p>
<p><em>The walk is for listening.</em></p>
<p>But I had listened. I had heard the scream. I had felt the Unison.
And in the vision, in the moment of catastrophic feedback, I had
seen—<em>felt</em>—the architecture of their control. It was a system of
resonant pathways, like a nervous system for the planet. And in any
nervous system, there are redundancies. Emergency shut-offs. Backdoor
signals for when the main brain is failing.</p>
<p>The water was at my knees, pulling at me. The groan of pressure was a
constant note. I waded to the wall where the glyphs had flowed most
strongly. I placed my palms against the stone. It was not inert. A faint
vibration, the last echo of the machine’s awakening, still trembled
within it. I closed my eyes. I let go of the cold, of the rising water,
of the image of Kaela being dragged away. I reached for the resonance in
my own skull, the tuning fork the walk had left inside me.</p>
<p>I did not push. I hummed. A low, steady note, matching the fading
vibration in the wall. It was not about force. It was about alignment. A
plea in the same key.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The water was at my waist. The cold was a clamp on my lungs. The
bioluminescence on the walls seemed to dim, as if drowning.</p>
<p>I thought of the final moment of the vision. Not the silent wave, but
the flight. The ones who fled into the deep places. They would have left
a way. Not for power, but for preservation. A failsafe for future
listeners, not conquerors.</p>
<p>I shifted the mental frequency. Not the song of control, nor the
scream of its breaking. I sought the quieter note beneath both: the
earth’s original, wounded hum. The scar tissue. I let my own breath rasp
in time with it, a broken thing.</p>
<p>A section of the wall under my right hand shimmered. Not with light,
but with a different density. A circle, the size of a plate, became
faintly transparent. Behind it was a lattice of crystalline filaments,
pulsing with a weak, tired blue light. A secondary node. A drainage
synapse.</p>
<p>I had no tools. No time. The water was at my chest. I pressed my
forehead to the cool, shimmering circle. I poured every ounce of that
broken resonance into it, not a command, but a confession of failure.
<em>We are listening. We are sorry.</em></p>
<p>The circle dissolved. The lattice of filaments was exposed. I didn’t
think. I drove my fist into it.</p>
<p>There was no shock. No pain. The filaments were brittle, ancient.
They shattered with a sound like distant wind chimes. The weak blue
light surged once, then died.</p>
<p>For a second, nothing. Only the cold, rising water.</p>
<p>Then, a deep, grinding shudder passed through the chamber. From the
entrance tunnel came a new sound—not the inrushing roar of water, but a
vast, gulping <em>slurp</em>. A whirlpool formed in the centre of the
chamber, spinning the black water. A hidden duct, an ancient overflow,
had been triggered. The water level stalled at my sternum. Then, with
agonizing slowness, it began to drop.</p>
<p>I clung to the wall, shuddering with cold and a relief so violent it
felt like a new kind of sickness. The water drained away, revealing the
chamber floor, carved with channels I hadn’t seen. It took an age. When
it was finally only a slick, black sheen, I collapsed, lying on the
stone, gasping air that was now laced with the salt and rot of released
sea.</p>
<p>I was alive. I was trapped. But I was not defeated.</p>
<p>The pedestal still stood, the charge on it blinking its steady, red
metronome. I crawled to it. The failsafe had drained the chamber, but
the vault’s primary systems were dead. The bioluminescence was gone,
leaving only the hellish blink of the charge. In that intermittent
light, I saw something else.</p>
<p>Where the primer had sat, where the pedestal’s material had flowed up
to embrace it, a pattern was faintly glowing. Not the grand, hovering
glyphs of the verse. This was smaller, subtler. A network of fine lines,
like the veins on a leaf or the tributaries on a map. At its centre was
a single, steady point of pale light. And from that point, a thin,
tenuous thread of resonance reached out, a ghost of a connection.</p>
<p>I understood. The primer was the key. But it was also a transmitter.
And this pedestal was a receiver. Vex had taken the transmitter, but he
had not severed the link. Not yet. This faint glow was the echo. The
backup signal. A whisper where there had been a shout.</p>
<p>I placed my hand over the faint, glowing point. The connection was
weak, fragile as a spider’s silk stretched across a chasm. But it was
there. It was a thread. And it led out of this tomb, through the rock
and the sea, across hundreds of kilometres, to the Double Peaks of
Tawangmangu. To the final vault. To Kaela.</p>
<p>The charge on the pedestal beeped, accelerating. A final, five-second
warning.</p>
<p>I turned and ran, not for the blocked entrance, but for the
newly-revealed overflow duct—a dark, sheer hole in the chamber floor,
still dripping. I had no idea where it led. Only that it was not
sealed.</p>
<p>I dropped into the dark, just as the world behind me dissolved into a
soundless, consuming flash of white. Not an explosion of force, but a
pulse of perfect, annihilating silence that swallowed the last echo of
the ancient song.</p>
<p>I fell through cold, rushing blackness, the thread of resonance from
the primer a faint, singing knot in my mind. A compass needle. A leash.
A lifeline.</p>
<p>The walk was over. Now came the chase.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-9-1"><strong>Chapter 9</strong></h2>
<p>The silence after the pulse was a new kind of sound. It was the
ringing in your ears after a gunshot, but deeper, a vacancy that had
weight and texture. I surfaced from the overflow duct not into the sea,
but into a subterranean river, a black, icy current that carried me
through a throat of basalt. The world was reduced to the slap of water
on stone, the burn of my lungs, and the faint, singing knot in my
mind.</p>
<p>The thread.</p>
<p>It was not a sound, not a light. It was a pressure behind my eyes, a
subtle tilt in my sense of balance, as if the planet had shifted its
axis by a single, critical degree. It pulled east-southeast. A spiritual
gravity. I clawed my way onto a slick shelf of rock, the darkness
absolute, and lay there, shivering. The vault was gone, erased by that
silent, white annihilation. All that remained of its song was this one,
tenuous filament, connecting the primer in Vex’s possession to the
receiver in my skull.</p>
<p>I followed it out. The river led to a crack in a mossy cliff-face,
hidden behind a curtain of thorny <em>simpur air</em> vines, on a
deserted stretch of the southern Java coast. The sky was the colour of a
fresh bruise, dawn bleeding into a stormy morning. The rain here was
different from Singapore’s solid walls. It was a warm, persistent mist
that turned the jungle into a steaming green lung. The air smelled of
wet earth, clove, and the distant, sulphurous breath of the island’s
volcanoes.</p>
<p>I had nothing. No pack, no weapon, only the soaked clothes on my back
and the hard, certain pull of the thread. It was a compass needle etched
into my consciousness. I could feel the primer moving, a bright, sharp
point of wrongness travelling inland, north and east, towards the
highlands. A convoy. Vex was not creeping. He was claiming.</p>
<p>The walk was over. Now came the chase.</p>
<p>I moved not like a man, but like a shadow the jungle had decided to
spit out. I stole a fisherman’s motorbike from a lean-to by a stilt
village—a rattling, puttering thing with a cracked plastic seat. I left
a stack of sodden, worthless rupiah from my pocket and a silent apology
in the air. The thread was a leash, and it was tightening. I could feel
the distance between us not in kilometres, but in the increasing
tautness of that psychic line, a hum that was building towards a
harmonic. The map in my mind, once fragmented and silent, was now alive.
The first vault in Singapore, a whisper of urban decay. The second in
the Java Sea, a silent, drowned chord. And now, the third, a growing,
resonant peak ahead, a dormant super-volcano called Gunung Lawu. The
Double Peaks of Tawangmangu were its shoulders.</p>
<p>The three points were not a triangle. They were a tuning fork. And
the primer was the mallet about to strike it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The highlands rose around me, the road a wet, grey ribbon clinging to
the slopes. Tea plantations gave way to dense, mist-wreathed pine
forests, the air growing thin and cold. The thread vibrated. They were
close, ahead on this same winding pass, the only viable route for
vehicles towards the old pilgrimage trails of Lawu. I abandoned the bike
in a ditch, its engine coughing to silence. The rain had softened to a
drizzle, the mist lying in the valleys like discarded wool.</p>
<p>I climbed. The rock was slick, the pine needles silent underfoot.
From a high outcrop, I saw them: three black, armoured SUVs moving like
beetles through the fog below, navigating a narrow section of road
carved between a sheer rock face and a precipitous drop into a ravine. A
perfect bottleneck. The thread sang, a painful, beautiful note. The
primer was in the middle vehicle. And with it, a fainter, familiar
resonance—Kaela. A muted, captive harmony.</p>
<p>The environment was not a backdrop; it was the only weapon I had.
Above the road, the recent rains had left the cliff face weeping, a
section of fractured rock and sodden earth held back by a net of ancient
tree roots. A precarious geology. A prayer waiting to be answered.</p>
<p>I did not think. I moved. The climb was a vertical scramble, fingers
seeking purchase in wet cracks, the world shrinking to the next
handhold, the next root. I reached the unstable shelf above the road.
The roots were thick as my wrist, straining. Below, the lead SUV was
passing through. Then the middle one, carrying my song. I braced my feet
against a solid rock, took a deep breath of the thin, pine-scented air,
and began to push against the main anchor-root, a groaning, fibrous
cable.</p>
<p>It was not about strength. It was about leverage. It was about
listening to the sigh of the earth. I pushed into the rhythm of the
mountain, a slow, grinding patience. The root creaked. A shower of
pebbles and mud pattered down onto the road, spattering the windshield
of the middle SUV. It slowed.</p>
<p>I pushed again, a steady, relentless pressure. The thread in my mind
was a scream now. The root snapped with a sound like a cannon shot.</p>
<p>The world came down. Not in a single, dramatic avalanche, but in a
rushing, roaring cascade of mud, rock, and shattered timber. It fell
between the lead SUV and the convoy, a sudden, earthen wall six feet
high, cutting the middle vehicle off. The third SUV braked hard,
skidding on the wet asphalt.</p>
<p>Silence, for a heartbeat. Then shouts. Doors opening on the third
vehicle. Armed figures emerging, scanning the cliffs.</p>
<p>I was already moving, sliding down the slope I had made,
half-swimming in the churned mud, coming down behind the isolated middle
SUV. The driver’s door opened. A man in tactical gear stepped out, rifle
raised. He didn’t see me, a mud-smeared spectre rising from the earth
itself. One strike to the throat, a twist to disarm. He fell, gagging,
into the muck.</p>
<p>The thread was a physical pull. I yanked open the SUV’s rear
door.</p>
<p>The interior was a capsule of sterile light and cool air. Vex sat on
the far side, a sleek case on his lap, his hand inside. His eyes, flat
and calculating, met mine. Between us, bound and gagged in the middle
seat, was Kaela. Her eyes were wide, not with fear, but with a furious,
blazing recognition. A map of bruises bloomed on her temple, but her
resonance was clear, a bell waiting to be rung.</p>
<p>“Leo,” Vex said, his voice calm, almost pleasant. “You are a stain of
remarkable persistence.”</p>
<p>My gaze was locked on the case. The primer was inside. I could feel
its output, a focused beam of ancient data screaming silently into the
ether, aimed at the final vault. It was an open wound in the world’s
quiet.</p>
<p>“It’s not a treasure map, Vex,” I said, my voice raw from swallowed
seawater and grit. “It’s a lock.”</p>
<p>“All locks have keys,” he smiled. His finger was on a trigger inside
the case. “And all keys confer power. You simply lack the imagination to
see its shape.”</p>
<p>He moved fast. But the thread moved faster. It wasn’t a thought; it
was a reflex. As he raised the case, aiming not at me, but at Kaela, I
didn’t lunge for him. I threw myself onto Kaela, wrapping around her,
turning my back to the case. I felt a <em>thump</em>, not of a bullet,
but of a concussive, resonant wave. It passed through me like an X-ray,
a burst of discordant frequency meant to disrupt, to shatter a tuned
mind. My own connection to the thread screamed in agony, a feedback
shriek, but it held. Behind me, Vex grunted in surprise.</p>
<p>In that second of his miscalculation, Kaela moved. Bound as she was,
she drove her head back into the headrest, rocking the seat. It was
enough. I reached back, blind, my hand finding the case. My fingers
closed not on the primer, but on the cabling around it. I pulled. There
was a crackle of severed connection, a dying digital squeal.</p>
<p>The primer’ broadcast stuttered.</p>
<p>Vex roared, a sound of pure, profane rage. He clawed at me, but the
SUV’s cabin was a cage. Shots rang outside—his men, firing at shadows in
the mist. I had the case. I dragged Kaela out with me, into the cool,
drizzling chaos. With a slash of a discarded knife from the mud, I cut
her bonds.</p>
<p>“The pass,” she gasped, rubbing her wrists. Her eyes were on the
case. “He’s rigged it. It’s a dead man’s switch linked to his
biometrics. If his heart stops, it broadcasts a full-trigger
sequence.”</p>
<p>Of course. A final spite. A burn-it-all-down clause.</p>
<p>“Then we don’t stop his heart,” I said, pulling her towards the
ravine edge. “We run.”</p>
<p>We went over the side, sliding and tumbling into the dense,
concealing pines as the shouts and gunfire concentrated on the blocked
road above. We left him there, trapped with his crippled weapon and his
wall of earth, the thread now a tangled, angry snarl in my mind. But we
had the primer. The physical key. And the map in my head was now
complete, the final glyphs slotting into place with a silent, profound
<em>click</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>We found shelter in a pilgrim’s cave, a shallow scoop in the rock
face smelling of old ash and damp stone. A small, clear spring trickled
down one wall. I opened the case with careful, trembling hands.</p>
<p>The primer sat inside, cradled in black foam. It was no longer inert.
It glowed with a soft, internal light, its surface alive with the
flowing, vein-like patterns I had seen in the pedestal. It was warm to
the touch. Not with heat, but with potential. Kaela watched, her breath
fogging in the cold air.</p>
<p>I placed my hands on it.</p>
<p>The world did not vanish. It clarified.</p>
<p>The three vaults blossomed in my consciousness not as points, but as
pillars. Singapore, the Foundation, rooted in the engineered stone of
human ambition. The Java Sea, the Depth, anchored in the primordial
ooze. And here, Lawu, the Apex, reaching for the sky from the planet’s
fiery heart. They were not a circuit to be powered. They were a triad of
tuning pins, holding a string in perfect, impossible tension.</p>
<p>The string was the tectonic suture line beneath the archipelago. The
lock was a stabilizer. The verse wasn’t an invitation to claim power. It
was a schematic for maintenance. A sacred duty. The ‘reward’ for solving
the puzzle was the crushing, eternal responsibility of ensuring the lock
held. The art was not in the opening, but in the perpetual, careful act
of <em>not</em> closing it. A valve on a pressure cooker the size of a
world.</p>
<p>I understood it all in a single, devastating instant. The knowledge
was not exhilarating. It was a weight, a yoke settled onto my shoulders.
I saw the faces of the Versehunters who had come before—not as greedy
adventurers, but as failed stewards. They had sought a prize. They had
found a burden. And they had broken under it, or fled, leaving the lock
to slowly degrade.</p>
<p>And Vex… Vex wanted to break it deliberately. To use the released
energy of a cataclysmic geological event as a weapon, or a currency. He
saw a bomb where there was a bearing.</p>
<p>I took my hands from the primer. The vision faded, but the
understanding remained, etched into me like a scar.</p>
<p>Kaela saw it on my face. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a treasure,” I said, my voice hollow in the small cave.
“It’s a chore. The most important chore in the world.”</p>
<p>I told her. The pillars. The lock. The suture line. The stabilization
field that quieted the fury beneath these islands. She listened, her
eyes growing darker, absorbing the scale of it.</p>
<p>“So the vaults… they’re not full of gold or secrets,” she said
slowly.</p>
<p>“They’re full of a single instruction: <em>Keep this turned
on</em>.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a long time, watching the mist curl past the cave
mouth. Then she nodded, a small, firm gesture. “Then that’s what we
do.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lifetime,” I said. “It’s every lifetime after this one. It’s
a chain.”</p>
<p>“It’s a thread,” she corrected softly, looking at the glowing primer.
“You followed one here. This is just a thicker one.” She met my eyes.
“He’s still coming. He’ll be on foot now, too. And he has the receiver
coordinates. He doesn’t need the primer to break the lock. He just needs
to get to the Apex vault and start cutting wires.”</p>
<p>She was right. The chase wasn’t over. It had just changed its nature.
We weren’t running to claim something. We were running to protect it. To
become its guardians.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking had found its answer. It was not enlightenment.
It was work. It was the mundane, eternal task of holding back the dark.
It was the most profound thing I had ever been offered.</p>
<p>“We need to get there first,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And we can’t kill him.”</p>
<p>“No,” she agreed. “We have to out-think him. We have to become part
of the lock he can’t pick.”</p>
<p>We drank from the spring. The water was clean, tasting of stone and
altitude. We shared a single protein bar from a survival kit in the SUV
case. The mist began to lift, shredding on the pine tops, revealing the
towering, twin peaks of Lawu above us, their upper slopes bare and
severe against the rushing grey sky. The final vault was up there,
somewhere in that ancient, sacred silence. The Apex.</p>
<p>The primer’s glow had steadied to a gentle pulse, in time with my own
heartbeat. It was no longer a foreign object. It was a tool. A
responsibility. I closed the case. The hum diminished to a bearable
whisper in my bones.</p>
<p>We left the cave as the first true light of afternoon broke through,
casting long, skeletal shadows from the pines. We began to climb, not as
thieves, but as pilgrims. The path was steep, the air thinning with
every step. The thread in my mind was no longer a tether pulling me. It
was a path I was choosing to walk.</p>
<p>Behind us, far below in the ravine of the broken road, I could feel
it—a discordant vibration, a snarled and angry knot of will moving
through the trees. Vex. Coming. He would not stop. The world, for him,
was a series of doors to be kicked in. He would reach the Apex vault,
and he would try to break the oldest lock in the world.</p>
<p>Our job was to be there when he did. Not to fight him for a
prize.</p>
<p>But to show him the door he was about to open led only to the fire.
And to stand in its frame.</p>
<p>The climb was no longer a chase. It was a consecration. Each step was
a word in a vow I had not known I was born to take. The cold air burned
my lungs. The primer’s weight in my hand was the weight of
continents.</p>
<p>Above, the Double Peaks waited, silent and immense. The final
chamber. The last verse.</p>
<p>We climbed.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-10-1"><strong>Chapter 10</strong></h2>
<p>The climb was a consecration. The air was a blade, honed on the high
stone of Lawu’s shoulders, and it pared away everything that was not
essential. Thought became breath. Breath became step. The world narrowed
to the volcanic grit under my boots, the ache in my thighs, the steady,
sympathetic pulse of the primer in its case against my back. Kaela moved
ahead of me, a silhouette against the rushing grey, her movements
economical as a prayer. We did not speak. The path was speech
enough.</p>
<p>It led us out of the pine forest and onto a spine of ancient lava
flow, a black, twisted river of rock frozen in mid-cataract. The mist
had burned away, and the scale of the place unveiled itself. We were on
the rim of the caldera. It was not a crater, not as I had imagined. It
was a world within a world. A vast, bowl-shaped valley cupped between
the twin peaks, its floor a tapestry of impossible green threaded with
silver streams and the white plumes of geothermal vents. The air here
was different. It carried a scent beneath the cold—a tang of sulphur, of
wet stone, of something deeply and electrically alive. The silence was
not an absence, but a presence. It had weight, texture. It was the
silence of a held breath.</p>
<p>The primer’s hum shifted. It was no longer a thread in my mind, but a
compass needle. It pointed down, into the heart of the green bowl.</p>
<p>“There,” Kaela said, her voice barely disturbing the air. She pointed
to a scar on the opposite rim, a raw, recent gash in the vegetation. A
landslide. “He didn’t follow the path. He cut straight through. He’s
already inside the caldera.”</p>
<p>He was a discordance. I could feel it now, not as a knot of anger,
but as a tear in the fabric of the silence. A violent, scraping
impatience moving through the sacred bowl. Vex.</p>
<p>Our descent was less a climb than a controlled fall. We half-ran,
half-slid down the inner wall of the caldera, through thickets of fern
and rhododendron that showered us with cold diamonds of leftover rain.
The geothermal activity grew more pronounced. Patches of ground steamed,
hissing like kettles. Strange, mineral-stained pools bubbled with a
lazy, malevolent heat. The air grew warm and damp in patches, then
bitingly cold again. This was not a landscape. It was a body. We were
moving across the skin of a sleeping giant, feeling its heat, its
breath.</p>
<p>The ancient defenses were not walls or gates. They were the giant
itself.</p>
<p>We crossed a meadow of soft, emerald moss. Kaela stopped me with an
arm. “Watch the step.” She nudged a stone with her toe. It rolled
forward onto the moss and vanished with a soft, sighing <em>puff</em>,
leaving a hole that exhaled a plume of warm, sulphurous steam. The
entire meadow was a thin crust over a network of fumaroles. A path of
slightly darker, firmer moss wound through it, almost invisible. A test
of awareness. A test of respect. Vex’s path was a brutal, straight-line
scar of broken crust and churned earth, steam jetting from the wounds
he’d torn in the skin.</p>
<p>“He’s not navigating,” I whispered. “He’s violating.”</p>
<p>“To him, it is the same thing,” Kaela said, her eyes on the trail of
vandalism. “A lock is a thing to be broken. A test is an insult.”</p>
<p>We followed the true path, our progress a silent, careful dance. The
primer’s pulse was a drum now, low and deep, felt in the teeth. It was
leading us toward the centre of the caldera, where the plumes of steam
were thickest, coiling into the sky like the pillars of a forgotten
temple.</p>
<p>Then the world erupted behind us.</p>
<p>Not with fire, but with sound. A shout, the crack of a branch, the
hard, metallic chitter of a weapon being armed. We spun. Four figures in
the grey-green tactical gear of the Guard’s rear detachment emerged from
the tree line on the caldera slope we’d just descended. They moved with
a professional, sweeping lethality. They had not taken the path. They
had come straight down, fast and loud, and they had our scent.</p>
<p>“Go,” Kaela said, and her voice was flat, final.</p>
<p>“No. Together.”</p>
<p>“The path is single-file here. They will bottle us. One holds, one
goes. That is the math.” She was already shrugging off her pack, pulling
a compact, matte-black device from it—a non-lethal pulse inducer,
designed to overload electronics and disorient neural systems. A tool
for a Warden. “The vault is close. I can feel it. You have the primer.
You have the thread. Follow it.”</p>
<p>“Kaela—”</p>
<p>“This is not a sacrifice, Leo. It is a tactic. I will delay, I will
misdirect, I will lead them on a merry dance through this steam bath.
Then I will catch up.” She met my eyes. There was no fear in her face,
only a fierce, practical light. “You must be the one at the door. You
carry the invitation. I am just the usher. Now, <em>go</em>.”</p>
<p>The first stun-round whined past, vaporising a plume of steam. The
choice was made, carved out by the geometry of the path and the cold
calculus in her eyes. I turned and ran, the primer’s case a burning
brand against my spine, its hum a scream of urgency.</p>
<p>I did not look back. I heard the sharp <em>crack-thrum</em> of
Kaela’s device, a shouted curse, the sizzle of electronics frying. Then
the sounds were swallowed by the hiss of vents and the hammering of my
own blood. I followed the dark moss, the pulse in my bones, the tearing
in my chest that had nothing to do with the altitude.</p>
<p>The caldera’s centre resolved through the veils of steam. It was not
a cave mouth or a grand arch. It was a grove. A circle of immense,
gnarled <em>sugi</em> trees, their roots like stone, cradling a natural
amphitheatre. In the centre stood a monolith. It was black, glassy
obsidian, shaped by no human hand, yet standing with a perfect, poised
balance. It was a keystone. The geothermal plumes rose thickest here,
wreathing the grove in a shifting, spectral light. The air vibrated. The
very ground seemed to hum a fundamental, subsonic note.</p>
<p>The Apex Vault. The lock was not on the stone. The stone <em>was</em>
the lock. And the entire caldera, the breathing, steaming, living
mountain, was its mechanism.</p>
<p>Vex stood before the monolith.</p>
<p>He looked smaller than I remembered, a stark, black-clad figure
against the towering obsidian. He had set up a portable console, its
screens casting a sickly, blue glow on the wet ground. Cables snaked
from it to probes he had jammed into fissures around the monolith’s
base. He was not trying to pick the lock. He was trying to give the
mountain a stroke.</p>
<p>I slowed, my breath ragged clouds in the steam. He hadn’t heard me.
His entire being was bent over the console, his fingers flying across
the interface. I saw the problem on the screens—a cascading series of
cryptographic prompts, environmental checks, biometric resonances. He
was brute-forcing them, using a bank of shimmering, prism-like
data-crystals to simulate the required keys. He was trying to shout the
mountain into submission.</p>
<p>And the mountain was groaning in response.</p>
<p>A deep, grinding tremor shook the ground. Gravel danced. The
<em>sugi</em> trees creaked. A jet of steam from a nearby vent roared
with sudden, furious intensity. On his screen, a warning glyph flashed—a
stylised mountain with a crack down its centre. He was bypassing the
protocols, and in doing so, he was destabilising the geothermal
pressures that the vault’s mechanisms carefully balanced. He was causing
seismic tremors.</p>
<p>He was going to blow the top off the sacred mountain to get to the
treasure inside.</p>
<p>I stepped into the clearing. The primer in my hand was no longer
humming. It was singing. A clear, pure tone that resonated with the
monolith, with the trees, with the deep hum of the earth.</p>
<p>Vex’s head snapped up. His face, illuminated by the console’s glow,
was slick with sweat and rapt with a terrible, focused joy. It didn’t
falter when he saw me. It widened into a grin.</p>
<p>“The librarian!” he called out, his voice cutting through the rumble.
“You’re just in time for the grand opening! I’m almost through the final
buffer. The old ghosts put up quite a firewall.”</p>
<p>“You’re not opening it,” I said, my voice sounding strange and thin
in the heavy air. “You’re triggering a containment failure. Look at your
seismics.”</p>
<p>He waved a dismissive hand, not looking away from his screen. “Side
effect of talking loudly to a deaf old machine. Once I’m in, I’ll have
control. I can quiet it down. The power in there… it’ll let me calm a
dozen volcanoes.” Another tremor, stronger this time. A crack splintered
up the face of a nearby boulder. “See? It’s waking up.”</p>
<p>“It’s dying,” I said, walking closer. The primer’s song was a
vibration in my palm, a wordless argument. “This isn’t a machine, Vex.
It’s a covenant. You’re breaking the terms.”</p>
<p>He finally turned to look at me fully, his eyes gleaming with that
intellectual hunger that knew no morality. “Covenants are for people who
need permission. Power doesn’t have terms. It has applications.” His
gaze dropped to the primer in my hand. His grin turned razor-sharp. “Ah.
You brought the key. Good. Saves me the trouble of spoofing the last
resonance. Hand it over. You can watch.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The syllable hung in the steam. It wasn’t a shout. It was a
statement, flat and solid as the monolith itself. It seemed to surprise
him. The manic energy around him stilled for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>“No?” he echoed, amused. “Librarian, look around you. The Guard is
minutes behind you. Your Warden is probably already wrapped in a
shock-cuff. You have a tool. I have the skill to use it. This,” he
gestured to the trembling mountain, “is happening. The only question is
whether you walk away with a share of the future, or become a footnote
buried in it.”</p>
<p>I moved to the other side of the monolith, facing him across the
black glass. I placed my free hand on its surface. It was warm, almost
feverish. The primer’s song flowed into it, and for an instant, the
tremor lessened.</p>
<p>“You think this is about a share,” I said. “It’s not. You think the
power in there is a weapon, or a battery, or a lever. It’s not.”</p>
<p>“Enlighten me.” He tapped a command into his console. Another, deeper
groan shuddered through the amphitheatre. Dust trickled from the roots
of the great trees.</p>
<p>“It’s a memory,” I said, the words coming not from my mind, but from
the resonance flowing through my hand. “A perfect, preserved memory of
balance. Of a world where power wasn’t extracted, it was participated
in. The Apex isn’t a stockpile. It’s a template. The last verse of an
instruction manual for a planet.”</p>
<p>Vex snorted. “Poetic. And useless. The planet is a resource. A system
to be optimised. This ‘template’ is a set of shackles invented by
primitives who were afraid of the dark.”</p>
<p>“They weren’t afraid of the dark,” I said, my voice rising to meet
the growing rumble. “They were <em>respectful</em> of it. They
understood that some fires you bank, you don’t stoke. Some doors you
watch, you don’t open. You see a lock to be picked. They saw a door that
kept a fire contained.”</p>
<p>“And I’m the fire?” he asked, genuinely intrigued.</p>
<p>“You’re the man who’d break the door to steal the flames, and burn
down the temple to keep himself warm for a night.”</p>
<p>He paused, his fingers hovering over the console. For a moment, I saw
something else in his eyes—not doubt, but a flicker of profound, almost
academic disappointment. “So small,” he murmured. “You hold a key to the
universe, and you see only… a thermostat. A moral lesson carved in
stone.” He shook his head. “A shame.”</p>
<p>He entered the final command.</p>
<p>The console screens flared white. The probes jammed into the rock
blazed. The monolith’s deep hum rose to a shriek. The ground didn’t
tremble—it lurched. A section of the amphitheatre floor, ten feet to my
left, slumped inwards with a roar, collapsing into a steaming crevasse.
The <em>sugi</em> trees swayed violently. The sky seemed to darken.</p>
<p>And the face of the monolith changed.</p>
<p>Where there had been smooth obsidian, a spiral of light appeared. It
was cool, blue-white, and deep within it, geometries shifted and turned,
aligning. An aperture irised open in the very centre of the spiral. Not
a physical door. A hole in reality, leading into a space that glowed
with a soft, earth-core light.</p>
<p>The Apex was open.</p>
<p>Vex let out a triumphant, wordless cry. He moved toward the light,
his console forgotten.</p>
<p>I didn’t try to tackle him. I didn’t shout. I simply raised the
primer and stepped into the light’s path, between him and the
aperture.</p>
<p>He stopped, inches from me. His excitement curdled into impatience,
then into something dangerous. “Move.”</p>
<p>“You wanted the key,” I said. The primer was blazing now, its light
merging with the light from the vault. “Here it is. But it’s not a
physical thing. It’s a state of being. It’s understanding what you’re
about to destroy. You can’t bypass that. You have to become it. Or you
go no further.”</p>
<p>He laughed, a short, ugly sound. “You’re going to <em>stand in my
way</em>? With what? A poignant metaphor?”</p>
<p>“With the door,” I said.</p>
<p>And I understood it then, the final, shattering truth. The primer
wasn’t just a key. It was a <em>part</em> of the lock. And so was the
person holding it, if they were aligned with its purpose. I wasn’t just
blocking the aperture. I was extending the lock’s protocol. I was the
final question the vault asked.</p>
<p>Vex’s hand shot out, not for me, but for the primer. His fingers
closed around it, over mine.</p>
<p>The world exploded.</p>
<p>Not in fire and rock, but in consciousness.</p>
<p>A torrent of information, of <em>feeling</em>, blasted through the
connection. I saw the mountain’s life, a slow, burning breath over
millennia. I saw the careful, loving work of the Wardens who had woven
the geothermal taps into a stable song. I felt the exquisite, fragile
balance of pressures, temperatures, and flows that kept the caldera from
tearing itself apart. It was a symphony, and Vex’s probes were a fist
slamming down on the keys.</p>
<p>And I felt Vex. Not his thoughts, but the shape of his will. A
brilliant, jagged, relentless spike of intention. A mind that saw the
symphony as a code to be rewritten, the balance as an inefficiency to be
corrected. To him, the sacred was just a system running on legacy
hardware.</p>
<p>The clash was silent, total, and agonising. It was two incompatible
truths trying to occupy the same space. The primer was the conduit. It
vibrated between us, a thing in agony. The light from the aperture
flickered wildly, strobing across the collapsing grove.</p>
<p>“Let… go…” he gritted out, his face a mask of strain.</p>
<p>“You… first…” The words were torn from me. The pressure was in my
skull, in my soul. I felt the mountain’s pain as my own.</p>
<p>He pushed, not with his body, but with that spike of will. He tried
to overwrite the primer’s resonance with his own, to make it a tool of
violation. I didn’t push back. I did the only thing I could think of. I
let go. Not of the primer, but of my self.</p>
<p>I stopped trying to be a wall. I became the thread.</p>
<p>I thought of the rain on the five-foot way. The smell of wet asphalt
and frangipani. The weight of a suitcase the colour of a bruise. I
thought of Kaela’s practical courage, of the silent Wardens, of the
clean taste of spring water. I thought of the quiet power of a thing
preserved, not because it is weak, but because it is precious. I offered
it all into the stream, not as a weapon, but as a testament.</p>
<p>The primer’s song changed.</p>
<p>It softened. It deepened. It became the drum of the Singapore rain,
the hum of the ancient stone, the beat of a heart that chooses to stand
and wait, to understand, to protect.</p>
<p>Vex’s will met not resistance, but a profound, enveloping
<em>context</em>. His spike of intention was not shattered; it was
surrounded, drowned in the sheer, vast <em>is-ness</em> of what he was
trying to break. His brilliant, narrow truth was shown to be a single,
screeching note against the chord of a world.</p>
<p>He gasped. His eyes, locked on mine, widened. For a fleeting, eternal
second, I saw not a monster, but a man—terrified, profoundly alone,
staring into the mirror of his own insignificance. He saw the fire
beyond the door, and for the first time, understood he was made of
kindling.</p>
<p>His hand jerked back as if burned.</p>
<p>The connection broke.</p>
<p>The physical world crashed back in. The tremors. The roaring steam.
The groaning trees.</p>
<p>Vex stumbled back, staring at his empty hand, then at me, his face
bleached of all triumph, all mania. He looked hollow. Lost.</p>
<p>The aperture in the monolith began to pulse, the spiral of light
contracting.</p>
<p>“It’s rejecting you,” I said, my voice raw. “The lock won’t hold much
longer. The mountain is coming apart. Go. Now.”</p>
<p>He didn’t move. He just stared at the closing light, at the ruin he
had authored.</p>
<p>A figure burst from the steam at the edge of the grove—Kaela, her
jacket torn, a burn on her cheek, but her eyes fierce and clear. She
took in the scene: the crevasse, the pulsing monolith, Vex standing
broken, me holding the shining primer.</p>
<p>“Leo! The whole caldera rim is destabilising! We have maybe three
minutes before this whole bowl cooks off!”</p>
<p>The primer was pulling me now, gently but insistently, toward the
closing aperture. The song was a summons. The final verse.</p>
<p>I looked at Kaela. I looked at the broken earth. I looked at the
light.</p>
<p>The vault wasn’t a prize to be won. It was a responsibility to be
entered. The only way to reset the lock, to calm the mountain, was from
inside. The template had to be witnessed, activated, by the key.</p>
<p>I had become the key.</p>
<p>“I have to go in,” I said.</p>
<p>Kaela understood instantly. She didn’t argue. She gave one sharp,
agonised nod. “Reset the sequence. We’ll hold the door.”</p>
<p><em>We</em>. She meant herself, and the mountain, and the ghosts of
all the Wardens. She would stand in the frame.</p>
<p>I turned my back on Vex, on the crumbling world, and stepped toward
the light.</p>
<p>Vex found his voice then, a shattered whisper. “What’s in there?”</p>
<p>I didn’t look back.</p>
<p>“The answer to the question you never knew how to ask.”</p>
<p>And I walked into the heart of the mountain.</p>
<p>The light enveloped me. It was not a tunnel, but an unfolding. The
roar of the dying caldera faded into a profound, resonant silence. I
stood in a space that was neither large nor small. The walls, the floor,
the ceiling—they were all made of the same substance: a living, glowing
crystal that pulsed with the same slow rhythm as the primer in my hand.
In the centre of the space floated a single, complex shape, a
three-dimensional mandala of interlocking gold and stone, turning slowly
in the air. It was the template. The memory of balance.</p>
<p>I could feel the mountain’s distress through the crystal—the
screeching feedback loops, the spiking pressures. The mandala’s turn was
jagged, erratic.</p>
<p>The primer was silent now. Its job was done. It had delivered the
custodian.</p>
<p>I reached out, not with my hand, but with the understanding it had
forged in me. I touched the mandala with my mind.</p>
<p>The world did not explode.</p>
<p>It healed.</p>
<p>A wave of calm, precise instruction flowed out from the mandala,
through the crystal, into the trembling geothermal veins. I felt valves
of stone sigh shut. I felt flows of immense heat gently redirected. I
felt fractures sigh closed. The mandala’s turn smoothed, becoming a
slow, stately, eternal rotation. The pulse in the crystal walls steadied
into a deep, restful beat.</p>
<p>The Apex was not a weapon. It was a tuning fork. And I had just
struck the note that brought the mountain back into harmony.</p>
<p>Exhaustion, vast and absolute, washed over me. I sank to my knees on
the crystal floor. The light was gentle now, nurturing. The mandala
turned, its perfect geometry a comfort.</p>
<p>I had done it. I had saved the temple from the fire.</p>
<p>Then the crystal beneath me shivered. Not with instability, but with
a new, <em>incoming</em> resonance. A different frequency. Hard,
metallic, and hungry. It was faint, coming from very far away, but it
was unmistakable. It was probing, searching, scraping against the edges
of the harmony I had just restored.</p>
<p>It was looking for the note I had just struck.</p>
<p>The primer at my side gave one last, faint, warning thrum.</p>
<p>The Apex was secure.</p>
<p>But I had just shown the universe how to find it.</p>
<p>The crystal walls, for the first time, felt less like a sanctuary,
and more like a lens, focusing a distant, attentive gaze directly on
me.</p>
<p>I was no longer a pilgrim in a sacred space.</p>
<p>I was a beacon in the dark.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-11-1"><strong>Chapter 11</strong></h2>
<p>The silence after harmony is a different kind of sound. It is not an
absence, but a fullness so complete it presses against the eardrums. I
knelt on the crystal floor, the deep, restful pulse of the mountain
moving through my bones. The mandala turned, a slow, golden clockwork of
peace. I had done it. The fire was banked. The mountain’s great heart
beat steadily, and I was a tiny, grateful creature resting against its
ribs.</p>
<p>Then came the scrape.</p>
<p>It was not a sound you heard with your ears. It was a vibration in
the teeth, a cold fingernail drawn down the spine of the world. It came
from a distance so vast it should have been meaningless, a whisper from
a dead star. But the crystal chamber was not a room; it was an ear. A
lens. And it focused that whisper into a clear, metallic signal.</p>
<p><em>Probe. Search. Scrape.</em></p>
<p>It was a different frequency. The opposite of the harmony. Where the
mountain’s song was fluid, geothermal, ancient, this was hard, machined,
and hungry. It slid over the surface of the newly-restored calm,
testing, tasting. Looking for a seam. Looking for the note I had just
struck.</p>
<p>The primer on the floor beside me gave a final, dull thrum. A stone
dropping into a deep well. A warning.</p>
<p>The peace curdled. The nurturing light in the crystal walls took on a
new quality: exposure. I was no longer a custodian in a sanctuary. I was
a lit match in a field of dry grass, seen from very, very far away.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up, my limbs leaden with a weariness that went beyond
muscle. It was the fatigue of the spirit. The primer’s work had hollowed
me out, and the act of tuning the mountain had filled that hollow with
something too vast for my frame. I felt thin. Translucent. And through
me, that distant, hungry signal pulsed.</p>
<p>I had to move. The thought was a dull instinct. The chamber had only
one entrance: the narrow, crystalline passage I had ascended. I stumbled
toward it, my hand leaving a damp print on the wall. The pulse of the
mountain was a comfort, but beneath it, like a stain on clean water, the
scraping persisted. It was learning. Mapping the edges of the
harmony.</p>
<p>The descent was a blur of refracted light and trembling muscle. The
crystal steps, once humming with potential, now felt like a ladder out
of a grave. I emerged into the circular antechamber where the three
arches stood. The murals seemed different. The depicted builders, with
their tools and their serene faces, no longer looked like pioneers. They
looked like sentries. Their eyes, in the flickering light from the
central crystal plinth, seemed to track me.</p>
<p>The artifact was where I had left it, on the plinth. It was inert.
Dull. Just a complex piece of carved stone. The connection I had felt to
it, the living thread of understanding, was severed. It was a spent
cartridge.</p>
<p>I picked it up. It was cold.</p>
<p>A low groan shuddered through the temple. Not the healing sigh of
stone, but the protest of a great weight settling. Dust, fine as
powdered bone, sifted from the ceiling high above. The global
destabilization. I had healed the mountain’s core, but the damage was
already done. The temple, this machine of balance, was coming apart.</p>
<p>I heard the shouts then, echoing up from the depths. Human voices,
sharp with panic. Leo. Vex.</p>
<p>I shoved the artifact into my pack and ran, not up toward the jungle
and the sky, but down, back into the temple’s wounded belly. The
light-strips in the floor flickered, casting stuttering, nightmare
shadows. The air grew hot and thick. The mountain’s new, steady rhythm
was being fought by the chaos Vex had unleashed in the control
vault.</p>
<hr />
<p>The vault door was ajar, a sliver of hellish orange light bleeding
into the corridor. The sound that poured out was a cacophony of
shrieks—overloading systems, tearing metal, and a human voice riding the
chaos like a jagged crest.</p>
<p>“—won’t have it! None of you will!”</p>
<p>Vex.</p>
<p>I slipped inside.</p>
<p>The vault was a vision of technological apocalypse. The central
console, that beautiful, terrible tree of light and data, was a seizure
of colour. Crimson alerts bloomed and died across every surface. The
holographic orrery of the temple’s systems spun wildly, trajectories
fraying into violent, spastic lines. The air smelled of ozone and
burning plastic.</p>
<p>Vex stood before the main interface, her back to me. She was a
silhouette against the storm of light, her hands raised like a conductor
before a ruinous orchestra. She wasn’t trying to control it anymore. She
was willing it to burn.</p>
<p>“You think your sacrifice matters?” she screamed at the console, at
the ghosts in the machine, at Leo who was crouched behind a secondary
terminal, his fingers flying across a smaller, intact touchpad. “It’s a
footnote! This power doesn’t want custodians. It wants a wielder!”</p>
<p>“It’s not a weapon, Elara!” Leo’s voice was hoarse, stripped raw by
the screaming systems. He didn’t look up. His entire being was poured
into the screen before him. “It’s a balance. And you’ve cracked the
scale.”</p>
<p>“I’ve <em>liberated</em> it!” She brought her fist down on a primary
rune-node.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate. A sound like a dying giant filled the
vault. A deep, structural <em>crack</em> reverberated through the floor.
On the orrery, an entire branch of the temple’s schematic—the western
geothermal vents—flared white and vanished. The floor lurched. A chunk
of the ceiling, a decorative panel of copper and lapis, sheared free and
crashed behind me.</p>
<p>The global destabilization wasn’t a theory anymore. It was in the
room.</p>
<p>Vex turned, her face illuminated by the strobing console. Triumph and
despair warred in her eyes. She saw me in the doorway. “Pilgrim! Come to
witness the birth of a new age? Or to die in the old one?”</p>
<p>“You’re killing the mountain,” I said. My voice was quiet, almost
absorbed by the din. It was just a fact.</p>
<p>“The mountain is a battery!” she spat. “And I am pulling the plug. If
the world can’t have it, no one can.”</p>
<p>She raised her hand again, aiming for the central core of the
console. A final, obliterating strike.</p>
<p>Leo moved. He came out from behind his terminal not with a tackle,
but with a lunge, his body a desperate, unarmed barrier between her and
the machine. He caught her wrist. They struggled, two figures etched in
firelight, a pantomime of opposition against the backdrop of
collapse.</p>
<p>Vex was stronger, fueled by a furious nihilism. She threw him off.
Leo stumbled back, hitting the edge of the console. A new alarm, deeper
and more urgent than all the others, began to pulse. A resonant,
bone-shaking hum built in the walls.</p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL OVERLOAD. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE
IMMINENT.</strong></p>
<p>The translation shimmered in the air, a final, elegant epitaph.</p>
<p>Vex looked at the warning, then at her hand, then at the heart of the
console. A strange calm settled over her. The debate was over. She had
lost. So she would turn loss into annihilation.</p>
<p>She smiled. It was the most terrifying thing I had seen in the
temple.</p>
<p>She slammed her palm, not onto a rune, but onto the smooth, glowing
surface of the main power conduit.</p>
<p>The console did not explode. It <em>imploded</em>. Light was sucked
inward from every screen, every hologram, every strip in the floor,
converging on the point of her touch. There was a silent, breathless
moment of absolute vacuum. Then it erupted.</p>
<p>The blast was not fire, but pure, concussive force. It threw Vex
across the vault like a rag doll. It shattered the remaining screens. It
blew the holographic orrery into a million dying stars. The vault door
shrieked on its hinges and slammed shut, sealing us in.</p>
<p>The lights died. All of them.</p>
<p>For three heartbeats, there was only blackness and the ringing in my
ears. Then, emergency luminescence, a faint, fungal green, seeped from
cracks in the walls. It illuminated a scene of wreckage.</p>
<p>The console was a blackened skeleton. Vex lay in a heap against the
far wall, not moving. Dust and smoke swirled in the green gloom.</p>
<p>Leo pushed himself up from where the blast had flung him, near my
feet. He was bleeding from a cut on his temple. His glasses were gone.
His eyes, when they found mine, were wide with a terrible clarity.</p>
<p>“The manual reset,” he coughed, the words gritty with dust. “The
failsafe. It’s the only thing left.”</p>
<p>He staggered to the ruined console. In the centre of the devastation,
one small panel still glowed with a soft, persistent blue. A single,
physical lever, carved from a dark, non-conductive stone, was housed
there. Unharmed.</p>
<p>“The builders knew,” he said, his fingers tracing the lever’s
housing. “They knew a custodian might face this. A total corruption of
the system.” He looked at me, and in the green light, he looked ancient.
“The primer. Did it… show you? The third vault wasn’t about power. It
was about sacrifice.”</p>
<p>The memory rose in me, not from the primer, but from the touch of the
mandala. The final, clarifying truth. The lock was not just sealed by
knowledge. It was sealed by choice.</p>
<p>“It requires a channel,” I said, the understanding dawning with a
cold, absolute weight. “A living conduit to carry the reset command back
into the mountain’s core. To bypass the wreckage.”</p>
<p>Leo nodded. He placed his hand on the stone lever. “The artifact.
It’s the key. But the key needs a turn. A… life force. To bridge the gap
between intention and action.” He gave me a ghost of his old, wry smile.
“Physics of the spirit, Lia. Every action requires an equal and opposite
reaction. To stop this,” he gestured at the crumbling vault, “requires a
push. A final one.”</p>
<p>He was not asking for permission. He was stating a fact. The vision
from the mural in the third vault crystallized: the builder, not wiring
the final connection, but <em>becoming</em> it, his essence flowing into
the crystal, sealing the lock with his own silence.</p>
<p>“No.” The word was out before I could think. “There has to be another
way.”</p>
<p>“The way <em>is</em> the other way,” he said, his voice gentle. “The
selfish way is Vex’s way. Burn it all. The selfless way… is this. It’s
not destruction. It’s a redirect. A closing of the circuit.” He looked
at the lever. “The primer chose you for the tune. It chose me for the
turn. I understand the systems. I can be the channel.”</p>
<p>Another tremor, stronger than any before, rocked the vault. A great
slab of the ceiling buckled. The sound from beyond the door was a
roar—the mountain itself, beginning to tear apart at the seams.</p>
<p>“Give me the artifact,” he said.</p>
<p>It was not a command. It was a request. The last one he would ever
make.</p>
<p>I pulled it from my pack. It was still cold, dead stone. I placed it
in his hands. Our fingers brushed. His were trembling.</p>
<p>He positioned the artifact on a specific indentation before the
lever. It fit perfectly. As it settled, a faint thread of blue light
travelled from the stone lever, through the artifact, and into Leo’s
waiting hands. He gasped, a short, sharp intake of breath. The light
climbed his arms, etching his veins in sapphire.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he whispered, to me, or to himself, or to the mountain.
“It’s just a door.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes. And he pulled the lever.</p>
<p>The world did not explode.</p>
<p>It <em>unmade</em>.</p>
<p>The blue light did not flare. It consumed. It poured from the
artifact, up Leo’s arms, flooding his torso, his neck, his face. He
became a statue of living cerulean glass. He did not scream. His mouth
opened in a silent, profound <em>Oh</em> of understanding.</p>
<p>And I saw it. Through him. Through the channel of his dissolving
life.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>I am not Leo. I am one of Many. We stand in a chamber of pure,
singing crystal. It is not yet a temple. It is a birth. The mountain’s
heart is wild, a newborn star of geothermal rage. We have built the
lock. We have crafted the Apex. But the final connection is unstable.
The system rejects the inert seal. It requires a pulse. A conscious,
willing pulse to initiate the eternal rhythm.</em></p>
<p><em>“The lock is a mind,” the First Builder says, her voice the sound
of wind over a flute. “It needs a first thought. A thought of peace, to
quiet the fire.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A thought is a life,” another says.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes.”</em></p>
<p><em>There is no debate. Only a slow, serene looking-around. We see
each other. We have walked the three paths: the path of stone, the path
of leaf, the path of breath. We understand the cost of balance.</em></p>
<p><em>I step forward. Not because I am braver. But because in this
moment, I am the most ready. My understanding is complete. I feel no
fear. Only a vast, impending clarity.</em></p>
<p><em>I place my hands on the core. I do not wire it. I open myself to
it. I let my consciousness, my individual spark, flow into the circuits
of stone and light. I think not of control, but of lullaby. I think of
the deep, slow breath after tears. I think of silence after a
storm.</em></p>
<p><em>My body grows cold. The light of my life becomes the first steady
pulse in the crystal. The wild heart of the mountain feels it. And
begins to slow. To match. To harmonize.</em></p>
<p><em>The others are weeping. But they are also singing. A single, low
note that carries my essence into the foundations of the world.</em></p>
<p><em>I am not gone. I am the first beat. The founding note.</em></p>
<p><em>I am the seal.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The vision shattered.</p>
<p>Leo was on his knees before the console. The brilliant blue light was
retracting, flowing back from his body, through the artifact, and into
the lever. But it was taking something with it. The colour drained from
his face, from his hair, from his clothes. He was becoming monochrome. A
photograph fading.</p>
<p>The artifact was no longer inert. It glowed with a soft, internal
radiance. It was fused to the console, the stone of the lever flowing
over it like wax, binding them together.</p>
<p>The shuddering of the mountain ceased. The roar of collapse softened
to a rumble, then to a sigh. The violent, spiking lines on the one
remaining flickering screen smoothed into gentle, rolling waves. A
single, steady pulse, deep and green, began to glow from the core of the
ruined console.</p>
<p><em>Reset Complete. System Stabilizing.</em></p>
<p>The translation hung in the smoky air.</p>
<p>The cost hung heavier.</p>
<p>Leo slumped forward. I caught him before he hit the floor. He was
light, impossibly light, as if the essence of him had been hollowed out.
His skin was cool. His eyes fluttered open. They were Leo’s eyes, but
the light behind them was distant, guttering.</p>
<p>“See?” he breathed, the sound a rustle of dry leaves. “Physics.”</p>
<p>A groan came from across the vault. Vex stirred. She pushed herself
up on one elbow, her body broken, her eyes finding the stabilized
console, the fused artifact, Leo dying in my arms. She understood. Her
face, for a fleeting second, was not triumphant or despairing. It was
empty. She had aimed for godhood or oblivion. She had been granted
neither. She had been rendered irrelevant.</p>
<p>With a final, grinding shriek, the section of ceiling above her gave
way. Tons of carved stone and earth buried her without a sound. The
vault fell quiet, save for the new, steady, green pulse.</p>
<p>Leo’s hand found mine. His fingers had no strength.</p>
<p>“The beacon,” he whispered, his gaze drifting toward the ceiling, as
if he could see through it to the crystal chamber far above. “You’re lit
now. They’ll come.”</p>
<p>“Who?” I asked, my throat tight.</p>
<p>“The ones who scrape.” He coughed, a dry, soundless thing. “The
hungry ones. The primer’s last gift… is a warning. The harmony… attracts
them. You struck the note. They’ll follow it.”</p>
<p>His eyes fixed on mine, holding onto my sight like an anchor. “Don’t
let them… tune it to their song.”</p>
<p>His breath left him. Not with a gasp, but with a slow, deliberate
release. A final exhalation that seemed to merge with the steady pulse
of the mountain. The light in his eyes did not go out; it simply
receded, joining a deeper, older rhythm.</p>
<p>I held him as the green light pulsed. On. Off. On. Off.</p>
<p>A heartbeat that was not his.</p>
<p>The vault was a tomb. For Vex. For Leo. For the dream of simple
discovery. The air was clearing, the dust settling. The mountain was
saved. The world above would never know how close it had come to fire,
or what that salvation cost.</p>
<p>I laid Leo down. I stood. My body ached. My spirit was a numb, cold
thing.</p>
<p>I looked at the console. The artifact—the key, the tuner, the
catalyst for sacrifice—was now part of the machine. A monument to a
choice. It glowed with a faint, persistent light, the same green as the
stabilizing pulse.</p>
<p>Leo’s final words hung in the silence.</p>
<p><em>You’re lit now.</em></p>
<p>I looked at my hands. They were just hands. They had packed a
suitcase in the rain. They had touched a crystal mandala and healed a
mountain. They had held a man as he turned himself into a doorway and
closed it behind him.</p>
<p>I was not a pilgrim anymore. I was not a custodian.</p>
<p>I was a beacon. And in the vast, listening dark, a hard, metallic,
hungry note was already echoing, searching for its counterpart. It was
following the trail of a healed mountain, a restored harmony.</p>
<p>It was following the sound of me.</p>
<p>I turned from the dead and the sealed lock. I walked to the great
vault door. It opened to my touch, smooth and silent. The corridor
beyond was dark, but stable. The temple held its breath.</p>
<p>I began the long walk up, toward the jungle, toward the sky, toward a
world that thought it was ordinary. The artifact was gone, fused into
silence. But the note it had helped me strike was still ringing out, a
perfect, clear frequency in the cosmos.</p>
<p>And I was the only one left who could hear the answering scrape,
growing slowly, inexorably, nearer.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-32-the-five-foot-way"><strong>Chapter 32: The Five-Foot
Way</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Singapore is a forgiving thing. It doesn’t arrive as a
wall, but as a veil, a soft grey sigh that blurs the edges of the towers
and turns the city into a watercolour. I stood under the five-foot way
of the shophouse, the covered walkway that was neither street nor shop,
a space for return. The air smelled of wet asphalt, <em>kopi</em>, and
the faint, enduring sweetness of frangipani from the tree that had,
against all odds, cracked its concrete pot and flourished. My suitcase,
the same small, hard-shelled thing the colour of a bruise, was dry. I
was waiting for the rain to ease, not for a break in the weather, but
for the right moment to step back into the world I had left behind.</p>
<p>It had taken months to walk out of that mountain.</p>
<p>Not in body. My body had emerged from the Temple of Echoes after
three days, guided by a silent, green-lit path, dehydrated and
scratched, my clothes stiff with dust and dried salt from tears I hadn’t
felt fall. The Chronos Guard had scattered like insects under a lifted
stone, their purpose extinguished with Vex’s death and the mountain’s
silent, definitive hum. The authorities found a confused geologist and a
sealed archaeological site showing minor, non-threatening thermal
activity. They filed it under “unexplained natural event.” They did not
file Leo.</p>
<p>I brought him out wrapped in a thermal blanket from his own pack. He
was light. The green pulse in the mountain had preserved him, a gentle
embalming. In Jakarta, I used the last of Thorne’s obscure contacts, a
woman who asked no questions and understood the sanctity of quiet
passage. He was cremated. His ashes now rested in two places: half
interred in a quiet corner of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, near the
great banyan tree he’d loved; the other half I had carried with me, in a
small, plain urn of polished river stone.</p>
<p>The mountain was saved. The world was ordinary. And I was a beacon in
that ordinary world, listening to a frequency no one else could hear.
Leo’s last truth was my new reality: I was lit. The artifact was gone,
fused into the mountain’s heart, a permanent tuning fork struck once.
But the note it had helped me sound—the note of my own spirit, clarified
through sacrifice and connection—was still ringing. And in the vastness,
something had begun to echo back. Not the scraping, metallic hunger I’d
first sensed, but something else. A presence. A curiosity. A distant,
resonant acknowledgement. It didn’t frighten me anymore. It was a thread
in the tapestry, a proof of connection. My seeking had become a
signal.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 1: The Unseen Recovery</strong></p>
<p>The recovery was not of the body, but of the story.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the museum was as I’d left it: cool, hushed, a secular
cathedral to forgotten time. Dr. Saito met me in the Southeast Asian
ceramics gallery. Her sharp eyes took me in—the new stillness, the
weight in the shoulders that was not fatigue but ballast.</p>
<p>“Kaela,” she said, her voice softer than I remembered. “Your
sabbatical report was… sparse.”</p>
<p>“Some things don’t fit in the fields,” I said. “Purpose of Travel:
Spiritual Inquiry. Findings: Inconclusive, yet transformative.”</p>
<p>She nodded, as if she’d expected this. “And Leo Thorne?”</p>
<p>“He won’t be returning.”</p>
<p>A long silence, filled with the mute history of a thousand glazed
pots. “His father’s research?”</p>
<p>“It will be published. Co-authored by myself and the estate of Leo
Thorne. We’re framing it as a speculative historical thesis with
anthropological commentary. The Echo civilization as a case study in the
spiritual costs of technological transcendence.”</p>
<p>“A warning for the ages,” she murmured, quoting my draft
abstract.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She studied a Ming dynasty vase, its blue patterns swirling like
captured smoke. “The board will call it fringe. Unsubstantiated.”</p>
<p>“Let them. Truth has a weight, even without evidence. It changes the
one who carries it. That has to be enough.”</p>
<p>She turned to me, and in her gaze, I saw not a director assessing an
employee, but a fellow seeker recognizing a milestone. “Your position is
here, whenever you wish. But your title… perhaps it should change. From
‘Archival Researcher’ to ‘Consultant in Resonant Histories.’” A faint
smile. “The pay is the same. The purview is… wider.”</p>
<p>It was a gift. A space for waiting, of a different kind. I
accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 2: The Archivist’s New Codex</strong></p>
<p>Leo’s old desk in the archives was cleared. His ghost was not there;
it was in the mountain, in the green pulse, in the smell of ozone and
soil. I did not sit there. Instead, I worked from the reading room,
assembling the Thorne Codex.</p>
<p>It was more than a paper. It was a testament. We wove together Elias
Thorne’s feverish data, Leo’s lyrical field notes, and my own clinical
observations of the temple’s psycho-acoustic effects. We presented the
Echo not as a lost city, but as a lost philosophy: a culture that heard
the fundamental frequency of the planet and, in trying to manipulate it,
learned that true harmony required sacrifice, not control. Their
extinction was not a tragedy, but a chosen silence—a return of the note
to the source.</p>
<p>The day it was accepted by a small but respected journal of
archaeological theory, I took the stone urn to the Gardens. It was late
afternoon, the light dappled. I poured his ashes at the base of the
banyan, its aerial roots forming a temple of living wood.</p>
<p>“You were right, Leo,” I said to the quiet air. “It wasn’t about
rewriting the score. It was about learning to listen to the silence
between the notes. That’s where the meaning is.”</p>
<p>A breeze moved through the canopy, a sound like a deep, approving
breath. The hungry, scraping note in my mind seemed to recede further,
soothed by this act of rightful return. The new signal—the curious,
resonant acknowledgement—pulsed, soft and clear. A greeting.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 3: The Restoration</strong></p>
<p>The publication caused a minor, academic ripple. “A romantic, if
unprovable, allegory,” one critic wrote. “A powerful mythopoetic
framework for contemporary ecological anxiety,” praised another.</p>
<p>But for a few, it was a key. Researchers studying unexplained sonic
phenomena in other ancient sites wrote to me. A physicist working on
quantum resonance sent a thoughtful, speculative email. The legacy of
the Thornes, once a stain of madness, was now a respected, if
unorthodox, branch of inquiry. Elias was restored. Leo was
vindicated.</p>
<p>Vex’s legacy evaporated. The Chronos Guard was a phantom, its assets
seized, its name a footnote in conspiracy forums. The world, obsessed
with its visible crises, had no room for a secret war over a mountain’s
heartbeat. The victory was invisible. The peace was profound.</p>
<p>And I, the beacon, lived with the signal. I learned to meditate not
to empty my mind, but to tune it. The returning pulse was not an
invasion; it was a conversation across a distance I could not fathom. My
spiritual seeking had begun with a desire to fix a broken past. It had
ended—or rather, transformed—into the act of holding a connection to a
vast, living present. I sought nothing now. I attended. I witnessed.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 4: The Space for No Longer Waiting</strong></p>
<p>Tonight, the rain is gentle.</p>
<p>Kaela meets me under the five-foot way. She carries no umbrella. Her
hair is beaded with moisture, her face calm. She has flown in from
Yogyakarta, where she is advising on the seismic stability of a temple
complex. She, too, is a consultant now. We are both translators between
worlds.</p>
<p>“You’re late,” I say, no edge in it.</p>
<p>“The rain,” she says, nodding at the shimmering street. “It makes the
city slow down. Makes you pay attention.”</p>
<p>We walk to a nearby hawker centre, the air thick with the symphony of
sizzling woks and murmured conversation. We eat <em>hokkien mee</em> at
a plastic table, the steam mingling with the humid night. We talk of
ordinary things: museum politics, geothermal quirks, a new book. The
unspeakable sits between us, a comfortable, shared silence.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we take a taxi to the top of Faber Peak. The rain has
stopped. The city is laid out below us, a galaxy of human light, and
beyond it, the dark, sleeping curve of the sea.</p>
<p>“Is it still there?” she asks quietly, looking at the stars. “The…
echo?”</p>
<p>I close my eyes. In my mind, the green pulse of the mountain is a
steady, distant thrum. And beyond it, fainter but unmistakable, is the
new signal—a complex, beautiful chord, listening back. “It’s not an echo
anymore. It’s a call. And a response.”</p>
<p>She takes my hand. Her palm is warm, real, grounded. “Do you know
what it wants?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think ‘want’ is the right word. It’s not Vex’s hunger. It’s…
recognition. Like meeting eyes across a crowded room. It knows I can
hear. And I know it’s there. That’s the connection. That’s the
purpose.”</p>
<p>“To be a witness,” she says.</p>
<p>“To be a bridge,” I correct softly. “A five-foot way between one
reality and another.”</p>
<p>We stand in silence as the city lights twinkle, a terrestrial mirror
of the stars above. The frantic seeking is over. The pilgrimage is
complete. I had left this island looking for a cure in the past, a way
to silence a scream. I returned having found a voice in the present—my
own—and having used it to sing a mountain back to sleep, and in doing
so, to sing a note that reached the cosmos.</p>
<p>My suitcase, the colour of a fading bruise, sits by my feet. It is no
longer a vessel for escape, but for carrying small, essential things: a
change of clothes, a notebook, a stone urn now empty. It is a tool for a
journey, not the journey itself.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking had led me to a terrifying, beautiful truth:
you do not find the connection by chasing it. You find it by becoming
still enough, clear enough, that the connection can find you. You become
the still point in the turning world, the listening ear in the noise.
You become, as Leo said, lit.</p>
<p>Kaela leans her head on my shoulder. The last of the clouds part, and
a single, bright star seems to pulse, just once, in time with the quiet
green rhythm in my soul.</p>
<p>I am not waiting for a break in the rain anymore. I am standing in
the space between, covered but open, part of the street and part of the
shelter, hearing the whole world’s drumming, beautiful song. And for the
first time since I stood here a lifetime ago, suitcase in hand, heart in
tatters, I am not waiting for anything at all.</p>
<p>I am home. And I am answered.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-13-1"><strong>Chapter 13</strong></h2>
<p>The peace of the answered is a delicate ecology. It is not an absence
of sound, but a new arrangement of it. The frantic, searching static of
my mind had resolved into a single, clear tone—the green note of the
mountain, the cosmic call—and around it, the ordinary noises of my life
now arranged themselves like respectful attendants. The hiss of the
kettle in Kaela’s shophouse kitchen was a white-noise halo. The distant,
predawn groan of a garbage truck was a bass pedal. The soft, papery
rustle as I turned a page in my notebook was the brush of a snare. I was
the still point, and the world turned around me, musical.</p>
<p>For three days, I simply existed within it. I slept deeply,
dreamlessly, in the spare room that smelled of teak and lemongrass
detergent. I ate the food Kaela put in front of me: <em>kaya</em> toast
with slabs of cold butter, brothy <em>bak kut teh</em>, spicy
<em>laksa</em> that made my scalp prickle. We talked, but not of Vex, or
the mountain, or the call. We talked of her work restoring a Peranakan
tile mural in Katong, of the stubborn mould in her bathroom grouting, of
a new coffee place in Everton Park that roasted its beans with gula
melaka. It was the mundane liturgy of a shared life, and I participated
with a reverence I had never before possessed. This, too, was part of
the song.</p>
<p>My suitcase, the colour of a fading bruise, remained unpacked by the
bed. It was no longer a symbol of flight, but its continued presence was
a question. A tool for a journey, I had thought. But what journey begins
once you have arrived?</p>
<p>On the fourth morning, the note changed.</p>
<p>It was not a shift in pitch, but in texture. A faint granularity,
like dust motes swirling in a sunbeam, appeared at the edges of the pure
tone. It was the aural equivalent of a lens focusing, bringing something
distant into a soft, insistent clarity. It wasn’t a new sound. It was a
layer of the existing one, now discernible. A harmonic, previously
buried.</p>
<p>I was sitting at the wrought-iron table on Kaela’s tiny back
<em>kawasan</em>, a pocket of space just large enough for two chairs and
a struggling fiddle-leaf fig. The air was thick, pre-rain, the sky a
uniform pale grey. I had my notebook open, not writing, just letting the
morning press against my skin.</p>
<p>The granular hum intensified. It pulled, not from the sky or the
city, but from the ground. From the direction of the city centre, from
under the weight of marble and finance and history.</p>
<p>The National Museum. Where it had all begun. Where the shard of the
Singa’s skull had hummed to me from its glass case, the first broken
piece of the tune.</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s voice, from a lifetime ago, echoed in the new silence of
my mind: <em>Some things are not meant to be found. They are meant to
find you, when you are ready to be found by them.</em></p>
<p>The shard had found me. The mountain had found me. This… this was
different. This was the note, <em>my</em> note, now finding something
else. An echo from a place I had already been.</p>
<p>I went inside. Kaela was at her drafting table, a magnifying lamp
throwing a pool of intense light onto a fragmented ceramic plate she was
piecing together. Her hands were steady, a dot of glue poised on the tip
of a fine probe.</p>
<p>“It’s pulling me,” I said, my voice quiet in the still room.</p>
<p>She didn’t look up, her concentration absolute. “The call?”</p>
<p>“A part of it. It’s coming from the museum.”</p>
<p>Her hand completed its motion, adhering a tiny fragment with
microscopic precision. She exhaled, set the probe down, and finally
turned. Her eyes were sharp, assessing. Not worried. Curious. “A
response to your response.”</p>
<p>“I think so. Like a conversation finding its thread.”</p>
<p>“Will you go?”</p>
<p>“I have to.”</p>
<p>She nodded, as if I’d confirmed the time. “Take an umbrella. The sky
is full of waiting.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The museum in the daytime was a different organism. Before, I had
moved through its climate-controlled halls like a ghost in a tomb, drawn
by a private, painful frequency. Now, I moved as a pilgrim. The grand
rotunda, with its stained-glass dome, was flooded with the diffuse grey
light from the skywells. Schoolchildren in matching polo shirts streamed
like colourful rivulets around the static islands of artefacts, their
voices a high-pitched chatter that bounced off the marble. Tourists
stood with audio guides pressed to their ears, listening to sanctioned
histories.</p>
<p>I bypassed the Singapore History gallery. The pull was not from the
Singa’s shard. It was deeper, lower in the building. Towards the
foundations.</p>
<p>The granular hum led me down a staircase, past a “Staff Only” sign I
ignored with a calm certainty, and into a corridor of plain white walls
and linoleum floor. The air grew cooler, drier. This was the belly of
the beast, the archival space where the past was not displayed, but
stored. The door at the end of the corridor was unmarked, but
unlocked.</p>
<p>The room was a conservator’s laboratory. Long tables were lined with
strange, silent machinery: spectral imaging cameras, suction mounts,
trays of surgical tools. Shelves held boxes labelled with accession
numbers. The air smelled of ozone, stale paper, and the faint, metallic
tang of old ink.</p>
<p>And in the centre of the room, on a table under a bank of LED lights,
was a boat.</p>
<p>Not a model. A fragment of a real one, about eight feet long, a
curved, blackened rib of ancient timber. It was charred, waterlogged,
its surface a cracked landscape of extreme age. It was being prepared
for some kind of analysis, probes and wires taped to its hull like
medical sensors on a sleeping giant.</p>
<p>The granular hum wasn’t just coming from it. It <em>was</em> it. The
green note in my soul vibrated in perfect, resonant sympathy with this
piece of silent, burned wood.</p>
<p>A man in a white lab coat and blue nitrile gloves was bent over the
stern section, a tablet in his hand. He was young, Chinese, with a
focused stillness I recognised. He felt my presence and straightened,
his eyes widening slightly behind his glasses.</p>
<p>“This area is restricted,” he said, not unkindly, but with firm
institutional authority.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. My voice was steady, tuned to the same frequency as
the boat. “What is it?”</p>
<p>He blinked, thrown by the directness. A lifetime of academia warred
with something else—the instinct of a fellow obsessive. “It’s a recent
find. From a salvage operation in the Kallang Basin. They were dredging
for the new drainage project and brought this up. Carbon dating places
it… well, it’s anomalous. Earlier than it should be, given the site’s
known history.”</p>
<p>“It’s burned.” “Catastrophically. A fire at sea, we think. Or a
ritual burning.” “Can I touch it?” “Absolutely not.” He took a step
closer to the artefact, a protective gesture. “The salts from your skin,
the oils… it’s incredibly fragile. It’s been under freshwater silt for
centuries. It’s only stable in this controlled environment.”</p>
<p>I didn’t move closer. I didn’t need to. The connection was not
physical. I closed my eyes, just for a second, and let the green note in
me swell, not to sing, but to listen.</p>
<p>The granular hum from the boat resolved. It wasn’t a single tone, but
a chorus of tiny, final moments. The scream of rending wood. The roar of
hungry flame. The hiss of water meeting fire. And underneath it all, a
deeper, more terrible sound: a profound, resonant <em>snap</em>, like
the heartstring of the world breaking.</p>
<p>My eyes flew open. The conservator was staring at me, his
professional detachment replaced by naked fascination.</p>
<p>“You hear it, too,” he said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>I looked at him, really looked. He wasn’t just a technician. His
posture, the intensity in his eyes… he was a listener. “What do you
hear?”</p>
<p>He glanced at the door, then back at me, deciding. He set his tablet
down. “Static. On certain radio bands. A… a patterned interference when
we try to take certain spectral images. The equipment malfunctions. And
sometimes… sometimes I think I hear singing. Very faint. Like a memory
of singing.” He gave a short, self-conscious laugh. “You’re going to
think I’m mad.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I don’t. My name is Eli.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Arjun Shah,” he said, automatically, then waved the title away.
“Arjun. I’m the lead conservator on this project. We call it the
<em>Naga’s Rib</em>.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because of the location. And the burn pattern. Local folklore, the
kind they don’t put in the school textbooks, talks about a great water
<em>naga</em>, a serpent-dragon, that guarded the entrance to the old
harbour. The story says a fleet of arrogant foreign ships tried to force
the passage, armed with fire. They wounded the <em>naga</em>, and in its
death-throes, it wrapped itself around the lead ship and dragged it
down, burning, into the mud. A myth, obviously. A just-so story for a
maritime disaster.”</p>
<p>I looked at the blackened timber. The note within it was a fossilised
scream of fire and drowning. “What if it wasn’t a <em>naga</em>?”</p>
<p>He followed my gaze. “What else could it be?”</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I was thinking of the Singa, the stone lion of the
mountain. A land guardian. Why not a water guardian? A protector whose
domain was the chaotic, vital space where the river met the sea, where
the island ended and the world began. A different kind of threshold
spirit.</p>
<p>“You said the dating was anomalous,” I said. “How anomalous?”</p>
<p>He chewed his lip. “Preliminary results suggest late 14th century.
Which is impossible for that site. The major settlement was at the mouth
of the Singapore River. Kallang was mangrove and fishing villages.
There’s no record of a vessel of this size, or this… this catastrophic
an event.”</p>
<p>“Unless the record was swallowed,” I said softly. “By mud. And by a
story that became a myth.”</p>
<p>Arjun was silent for a long moment. The hum between the boat and my
soul was a tangible thing in the sterile air. “Why are you here?” he
finally asked. “Really.”</p>
<p>“I think your <em>Naga’s Rib</em> is calling for a witness. And I’ve
recently become qualified.”</p>
<p>I told him. Not everything, but enough. The shard. The mountain. The
green note. The call from the stars. I spoke in a low, measured tone,
matching the rhythm of the laboratory’s hidden hum. He listened without
interruption, his scientist’s skepticism overridden by the evidence of
his own ears and the uncanny certainty in mine.</p>
<p>When I finished, he walked to a cabinet, unlocked it, and pulled out
a small archival box. He brought it to the table next to the boat, but
not too close. He lifted the lid. Inside, nestled in custom-cut grey
foam, were a dozen objects recovered from the silt around the wreck.
Mostly corroded metal: a few coins, a buckle, a knife blade. And one
thing that was not metal.</p>
<p>It was a whistle. Carved from a dense, dark bone that was not ivory.
It was short, simple, shaped like a hollowed-out seed. It was
unburned.</p>
<p>“This was found near the stern,” Arjun said, his voice hushed. “It’s
made of whale bone, we think. Or something like it. It’s the only
organic object from the site that isn’t charcoal.”</p>
<p>The moment I saw it, the granular hum from the boat focused into a
sharp, piercing point. The chorus of fire and snapping timber faded, and
from the whistle emanated a single, clear, desperate note. A note meant
to be blown. A summoning. Or a warning.</p>
<p>“It’s a calling-piece,” I breathed. “For the guardian. For the
<em>naga</em>, or whatever it was.”</p>
<p>“It was never used,” Arjun said. “Or it was used too late.”</p>
<p>I understood. The catastrophic <em>snap</em> in the boat’s song. The
guardian had been killed. Severed. Its connection to the place broken in
violence and fire. The whistle was the un-uttered cry for help, the
unanswered prayer, fossilised in silt and time.</p>
<p>My green note trembled in resonance with it. I had sung a mountain
back to sleep. I had answered a cosmic call. And now I was being shown a
wound—a severed connection in the spiritual ecology of the island
itself. A hole in the song where a protector’s voice should be.</p>
<p>“It’s not just calling for a witness,” I said, the truth dawning with
a cold, heavy clarity. “It’s calling for a repair.”</p>
<p>Arjun stared at the bone whistle. “How does one repair a myth?”</p>
<p>“You don’t repair the myth,” I said, my eyes on the blackened rib of
the ship. “You repair the silence.”</p>
<hr />
<p>I left the museum as the promised rain began, a fine, persistent
drizzle that turned the afternoon into a watercolour wash. The green
note in me was no longer a pure, peaceful tone. It was now a channel,
and through it flowed the desperate, silent scream of the bone whistle
and the agonised chorus of the <em>Naga’s Rib</em>. The answered peace
was gone, replaced by a quiet, urgent responsibility.</p>
<p>Kaela was waiting when I returned, two cups of steaming <em>teh
tarik</em> on the table. She took one look at my face and said, “The
journey.”</p>
<p>I nodded, sinking into a chair. The warmth of the glass was a minor
anchor. “It’s a wound. An old, deep one. In the water. A guardian was
killed. Its… its frequency was severed.”</p>
<p>I told her of Arjun, the boat, the whistle. She listened, her face a
mask of calm concentration, but her eyes were stormy.</p>
<p>“A bridge between realities,” she murmured, echoing my words from the
rooftop. “And now you feel you must bridge a broken past.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a feeling. It’s a direct line. The call I answered… it’s
tuned me to these frequencies. I can hear the break. The silence where
there should be a song is louder than any noise.” I looked at my hands.
“I sang a mountain to sleep. Can I… sing a connection back to life?”</p>
<p>“That is a different kind of magic,” she said. “That is not lullaby.
That is resurrection.”</p>
<p>The word hung in the humid air, too large, too theological. “Not
resurrection. Maybe… a grafting. A way to let the old pattern resonate
again through a new string.”</p>
<p>“And where would you find this new string, Eli?”</p>
<p>I had no answer. The rain tapped its endless code against the window.
The pull was no longer towards a location, but towards an action. And I
had no score, no libretto for this work.</p>
<p>Later, in the deep indigo of evening, my phone lit up with a number I
didn’t recognise. The text message was brief.</p>
<p><em>Eli. Arjun. I’ve been reviewing the sonar maps of the dredge
site. There’s an anomaly. A density mismatch in the silt, about fifty
metres from where the Rib was found. Shape is… organic. Elongated.
They’re going back in two days to investigate. If you want to see, be at
the Marina East gate, 6 AM. No guarantees. -A</em></p>
<p>I read the message three times. An organic shape. Elongated.</p>
<p>The <em>naga</em> itself.</p>
<p>Not a myth. A corpse.</p>
<p>The hook was not in my mind anymore. It was in my soul, sharp and
undeniable. The journey was no longer metaphorical. It was a specific
time, a specific gate, a specific descent into the wet, dark past. The
spiritual seeking had ended on the rooftop. This was something else.
This was spiritual surgery.</p>
<p>I looked out at the night, at the city lights reflected in a million
raindrops on the glass. I was not waiting for a break in the rain
anymore. I was preparing to walk into the heart of the storm, into the
mud where history and myth had bled together, to listen to the oldest
silence of all.</p>
<p>I am home. And I am answered.</p>
<p>And the answer is a summons to the depths.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-14-1"><strong>Chapter 14</strong></h2>
<p>The rain at dawn was not a wall. It was a veil, a fine, persistent
gauze that turned the sodium lights of Marina East into smeared halos.
It was the kind of rain that didn’t drum; it hissed, a steady exhalation
from the concrete and the sea. I stood at the service gate, a
utilitarian slash in a high fence, the colour of tired algae. My clothes
were wrong—jeans, a thin cotton shirt, shoes meant for pavement, not for
mud. The bruise-coloured suitcase was back in the shophouse. All I
carried was a small waterproof pouch, inside it my phone, a notebook
warped from the humidity, and the smooth, cold weight of the river stone
from the <em>Rib</em>. A talisman, or a witness.</p>
<p>Arjun was already there, a silhouette against the grey bloom of the
sea. He was talking to a man in high-visibility orange, the plastic of
his raincoat cracking with every small movement. When he saw me, he gave
a short, sharp nod. No smile. This was not a place for social
punctuation.</p>
<p>“Eli. This is Pak Hassan. Site foreman.”</p>
<p>Pak Hassan looked me over, his eyes settling on my shoes. A faint,
almost imperceptible sigh escaped him, a puff of steam in the damp air.
“You stay where I say. You move when I say. You look where I point. The
mud, it does not care about your curiosity. It only cares about weight.
And it is hungry.”</p>
<p>His voice was gravel wrapped in silk, a voice that had commanded
machines over the shriek of wind and tide for thirty years. I nodded.
The hook in my soul twisted, a cold barb.</p>
<p>We passed through the gate. The world changed. The orderly geometry
of the city—the lines of the park, the curves of the bayfront—fell away.
Here was a raw, provisional landscape. The dredge site was a vast,
water-filled wound in the coastline, cordoned off by temporary
sheet-piling that rose from the water like the rusted teeth of a sunken
leviathan. Within it, the sea was the colour of clay, agitated and
opaque. A crane stood sentinel, its yellow paint a violent shout against
the monochrome sky. A barge, low in the water, was tethered nearby, and
on it sat a machine that looked like a mechanical nightmare of claws and
hydraulic joints—a clamshell grab.</p>
<p>The air smelled of diesel, of saline rot, of the profound, iron tang
of disturbed earth.</p>
<p>“The anomaly is there,” Arjun said, pointing to a spot about fifty
metres from the barge. A cluster of red buoys bobbed in the murk. “The
sonar ping was… unusual. Hard edges. A consistent density. Not rock. Not
modern debris. Too straight for nature, too irregular for a pilon.”</p>
<p>“A bone,” I said. The word was a stone dropped into the well of the
morning.</p>
<p>“Maybe. If bones were twenty metres long.” He glanced at Pak Hassan,
who was speaking into a radio. “They will use the grab first. To clear
the overburden. The silt layer is about four metres deep at that point.
Then, if they see something, they will send divers. Visibility is zero.
It will be by touch only.”</p>
<p>The rain hissed. The crane’s engine coughed, then settled into a
deep, bronchial idle. The hook in my chest was a physical pull now, a
line running from my sternum down into that specific patch of troubled
water. <em>The oldest silence of all</em>. I had come to listen. But
this place was not silent. It was a cacophony of industry, a roar meant
to suppress the whispers of the deep. I closed my eyes for a second,
trying to tune past the diesel thunder, to the frequency beneath. I
heard nothing but the blood in my own ears, the hollow ringing that had
been with me since London. The lullaby was gone. This was the
anti-lullaby.</p>
<p>Pak Hassan barked a command. The crane operator, a tiny figure in his
high cab, acknowledged with a wave. The machinery began to sing its own
brutal opera. Chains clanked. The clamshell grab, its jaws wide like a
titanic, steel scallop, was lifted from the barge deck. It swung out
over the water, a pendulum of calculated force, and hung for a moment
over the red buoys. Then it was released. It fell with a sound that was
not a splash but a <em>gulp</em>, a deep, swallowing noise as the water
parted and then closed over it.</p>
<p>We watched the cables tighten, vibrating. The crane groaned. The grab
was digging, its jaws scouring the seabed, filling its maw with
centuries of accumulated silt and memory. Minutes passed, marked only by
the strain of the engine and the patter of rain on my shoulders. The
crane lifted. The grab emerged from the water, streaming thick, grey
liquid, a slurry of time and decay. It swung over to a designated dump
area on the barge and opened. A ton of primordial ooze slid out with a
wet, sighing collapse.</p>
<p>They repeated the process. Again. And again. Each bite was a
violation, an excavation of a sealed layer. Each dump revealed nothing
but uniform, slick mud. The romantic notion—that one grab would emerge
cradling a sacred, curved ivory tusk—evaporated. This was archaeology by
bludgeon. This was turning a sacred page with a shovel.</p>
<p>After the seventh load, Arjun shifted beside me. “It could be deeper.
Or the sonar could be wrong. A ghost in the machine.”</p>
<p>Pak Hassan lit a cigarette, cupping his hand against the drizzle. His
face was impassive. “The machine is not wrong. The ground is shy.”</p>
<p>On the ninth lift, something changed. The grab came up, but it did
not swing immediately to the barge. It hung, dripping, over the water.
From the crane cab, a sharp whistle cut the air. Pak Hassan dropped his
cigarette, stamped it into the mud, and raised his radio.</p>
<p>“<em>Apa?</em>”</p>
<p>The radio crackled. The operator’s voice was tinny with excitement.
“<em>Bukan lumpur. Ada kayu.</em>”</p>
<p>Not mud. There is wood.</p>
<p>Arjun’s breath caught. My hand went to the pouch at my side, fingers
finding the river stone. <em>Wood</em>. Not bone. A different kind of
relic.</p>
<p>“Tell him to set it down gently! On the barge!” Arjun said, his
academic calm fracturing.</p>
<p>Pak Hassan relayed the command. The grab, moving with a new,
deliberate care, traversed the short gap and lowered its cargo onto the
steel deck. We moved as one, sloshing through the churned mud to the
barge’s edge, scrambling up a slippery ladder.</p>
<p>The grab had opened. Spilling from it was not a clean, carved timber,
but a blackened, twisted mass, encased in a shell of hardened silt. It
was about the size of a small canoe, but grotesquely misshapen, like
something that had been melted and then petrified. It smelled of peat
and salt and a profound, cellular age.</p>
<p>“Teak,” Pak Hassan said, kneeling beside it. He scraped a patch with
his knife. A hint of rich, deep brown showed through the black. “Old.
Very old.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a ship’s plank,” Arjun murmured, circling it. “The curve is
wrong. Too acute. And the thickness…” He looked at me, his eyes alight.
“It’s a rib. A <em>structural</em> rib. But not from a boat.”</p>
<p><em>The Rib</em>. The capitalisation was automatic in my mind. This
was not <em>a</em> rib. This was another one. A sibling to the artifact
in the climate-controlled lab. The hook in my soul vibrated, a plucked
string. The silence was breaking, not with a song, but with the groan of
tortured wood.</p>
<p>“There will be more,” I said, my voice strange to my own ears. “It’s
not a lone piece. It’s part of a…”</p>
<p>I didn’t finish. The crane whistle blew again, two short, urgent
blasts.</p>
<p>We turned. The grab had gone in for another bite, adjacent to the
first. It was emerging now. And it was not coming up empty. Entangled in
its steel jaws, held in a brutal embrace, was a long, curved shape. It
was not wood.</p>
<p>It was bone.</p>
<p>A great, sweeping arc of ivory-grey, streaked with black anaerobic
stains, thicker than my thigh and tapering to a point. It was caked in
mud, but its essence was undeniable. It was a tusk. Or a fang. Or a
horn. It was the physical manifestation of a myth, ripped from its bed
of time.</p>
<p>The grab held it aloft over the water, a grotesque trophy. The rain
fell on it, washing runnels in the grime.</p>
<p>The world shrank to that shape. The diesel roar faded. The hiss of
the rain became the hiss of static, of a channel opening. I felt a
pressure in my inner ear, a popping, as if I had descended too fast. The
hollow ringing in my bones was gone, replaced by a new frequency—a deep,
sub-auditory hum, a note of immense pain and immense age. It was not a
song. It was a held chord of extinction, a vibration of loss so complete
it had fossilised into sound.</p>
<p><em>The naga itself. Not a myth. A corpse.</em></p>
<p>This was it. The answer to the summons. I had been pulled here to
witness this violation. This was the grafting. The new string was this
monstrous, beautiful bone, and it was resonating with the old, broken
pattern of the world, and the sound was unbearable.</p>
<p>I must have made a noise. Arjun grabbed my arm. “Eli?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t speak. I was listening. The hum was coalescing, forming
something at the edge of meaning. Not words. A feeling. A vast, slow,
curling sensation of <em>wrongness</em>. Of a sleep shattered. Of a
body, dismembered and scattered, suddenly aware of its own
separation.</p>
<p>Pak Hassan was shouting at the crane operator to lower it gently. But
the grab was not designed for gentleness. As it began to swing towards
us, one of the great steel teeth, slick with mud, slipped against the
curve of the bone.</p>
<p>There was a sound. A crack.</p>
<p>It was not loud. It was a dry, sickening snap, the sound of a dead
branch giving way, amplified by the very resonance I felt in my teeth.
The bone, twenty millennia old, survived by the perfect, silent
chemistry of its preservation, fractured. A three-foot-long splinter
sheared away from the main column. It twisted in the air, a pale dagger,
and plunged point-down into the soft mud at the very edge of the dredge
pit, a hand’s breadth from the dark water.</p>
<p>Time stopped.</p>
<p>The hum in my skull spiked into a silent scream. The pressure in my
head was agony. I clapped my hands over my ears, but it was inside.
Arjun was saying something, Pak Hassan was roaring, the crane engine
whined. But it was all behind a thick pane of glass.</p>
<p>My eyes were locked on the splinter of bone in the mud. It stood
upright, quivering. And as I watched, a thin, dark line of something
began to weep from its fractured tip. Not mud. Something thicker,
darker, with a rainbow sheen like rotting petrol. It oozed, slow and
deliberate, down the ivory surface, and began to pool in the mud around
its base.</p>
<p>The grab, now holding the main, broken body of the bone, settled onto
the barge with a heavy thud. The damage was done. The surgery was
botched.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking had ended on the rooftop. The spiritual surgery
had begun here, in the mud. And I had just felt the patient
convulse.</p>
<p>The hum began to change. The note of loss was curdling, twisting into
something else. Something active. Not pain, but purpose. A cold,
ancient, and utterly alien purpose.</p>
<p>The pull was no longer just a hook in my soul. It was a command. It
came from the oozing splinter in the mud. It was not a call to look. It
was a call to <em>approach</em>.</p>
<p>I shook off Arjun’s hand. My movements felt slow, underwater. I
stepped off the barge, back into the knee-deep mire. I didn’t look at
the men calling after me. I walked towards the bone. The mud sucked at
my shoes, trying to claim them. With each step, the hum clarified,
organizing itself into a pattern, a rhythm. It was a pulse. A slow,
deliberate, tidal pulse.</p>
<p>I stood before the splinter. The pool of black ichor was wider now,
mirroring the grey sky. The bone itself seemed to throb with a faint,
internal luminescence, a trick of the light and my straining senses. The
fracture surface was a jagged mouth, weeping its ancient sap.</p>
<p>This was not an artifact. This was a wound.</p>
<p>And the city, this whole engineered island built on reclaimed sea and
buried myth, was the body around it. I had asked for a connection. I had
been granted one. It was not a melody to be sung. It was a hemorrhage to
be stanched. Or a signal to be answered.</p>
<p>I knelt. The mud soaked through my jeans, cold and final. I reached
out, my hand hovering over the weeping fracture. I did not need to touch
it. The frequency was a physical wall here. It vibrated in the marrow of
my own bones, a sympathetic resonance that was neither welcome nor
safe.</p>
<p>The answer was a summons to the depths.</p>
<p>And the depths had answered back. Not with silence. With a slow,
spreading stain, and a pulse that was now my pulse. The hook was set.
The line was taut. And I was no longer holding the rod. I was the bait,
and the catch, and the water into which the line descended, all at
once.</p>
<p>I am home. And I am answered.</p>
<p>And the answer is bleeding in the mud before me, calling my name in a
language older than tongues.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-15-1"><strong>Chapter 15</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. It remembers. It falls now on
the Kranji mudflats, a steady, grey hiss on the tidal slop, on the
plastic flotsam, on the bowed backs of the men on the barge. It fell
like this, perhaps, the day the thing in the mud was broken. It would
have diluted the ichor then, too, spreading the stain into the
groundwater, into the roots of the mangroves, into the slow, secret
veins of the island.</p>
<p>I knelt in the centre of that memory. The cold of the mud was
geological. It climbed my legs, a claiming chill. My hand did not
tremble as it hovered over the fracture in the bone. It was held,
suspended in the frequency that poured from the wound. The hum was
inside my skull, a second, heavier heartbeat. It was not sound. It was
pressure. The pressure of a deep place, a place without light, speaking
upwards through a crack in the world.</p>
<p>Arjun’s voice came from far away, muffled by the drumming rain and
the thicker wall of resonance. “Rafi! Get back!”</p>
<p>I did not look. Looking was for surfaces. The splinter was not a
surface. It was an opening. The black sap welled, not with the
randomness of seepage, but with a languid, purposeful rhythm. Each
droplet formed, swelled, detached with the solemnity of a ritual
gesture. This was not decay. This was utterance.</p>
<p>The purpose that had curdled in my chest was not my own. It was a
borrowed will, an ancient imperative flowing into the hollow spaces the
jet lag and the searching had carved out of me. I had come to Singapore
a frayed thread, looking for an end to tie to. I had found the other
end, but it was not loose. It was anchored in the abyss, and it was
pulling.</p>
<p>I lowered my hand.</p>
<p>The moment before contact was a vacuum. The rain-noise vanished. The
shouted warnings vanished. There was only the pulse, and the dark mirror
of the ichor, and the bone that was not bone.</p>
<p>My fingertips touched the weeping fracture.</p>
<p>The world did not explode. It inverted.</p>
<hr />
<p>The sensation was not of being pulled, but of being
<em>unfolded</em>. A single, vertiginous lurch, as if the axis of my
spine had been yanked sideways into a new geometry. The mud, the rain,
the grey sky—they peeled away like a scrim. Not into darkness, but into
a profound, textured absence. A negative space that was full of
feeling.</p>
<p>I was in the mud. I could still feel its clammy grip on my knees, the
rain spotting my neck. But I was also <em>elsewhere</em>. A elsewhere of
pure resonance.</p>
<p>It was a cathedral of pressure. A landscape built not from stone and
light, but from layers of silent sound, from the gravitational hum of
immense weight, from the slow, crystalline grief of things forgotten. I
had no eyes here, but I perceived. Above—a concept that had no
meaning—was a crushing blanket of time, sediment compacted into eons.
Below—another useless word—was a hot, mineral ache, the planet’s molten
heart. And through it all, running like a fault line through the strata
of silence, was the fracture.</p>
<p>It was a scar in the deep places. A ragged, singing tear. From it
bled not ichor, but a profound and lonely <em>awareness</em>. It was the
awareness of the buried thing. It knew its own brokenness. It knew its
exile. It knew the miles of rock and water above it, the insignificant
crust upon which a city of glass now danced. And it knew
<em>me</em>.</p>
<p>My consciousness, a tiny, flickering candle in this vault of geologic
self-regard, was seen. The attention that focused on me was vast and
slow. It was the attention a mountain might give to a lichen speck on
its flank. Curious. Oblivious. Potentially annihilating.</p>
<p>A concept formed, not in words, but in a shift of pressure, a new
harmonic in the hum. It was a single, clear datum of communication,
heavy with the patience of stone.</p>
<p><em>You are of the surface.</em></p>
<p>It was not a question. It was a categorization. I was a thing of the
thin, noisy, ephemeral world. A mayfly.</p>
<p>Another pressure-shift. A different quality. This one carried a
flavour of… recognition? Not of me, but of the quality of my seeking.
The hollow ringing in my bones that I had mistaken for jet lag was a
tuning fork, and it had been struck by a frequency from the deep.</p>
<p><em>You called. You listened. You heard the break in the
song.</em></p>
<p>The song. The idea arrived with a cascade of associated sensations—a
memory of a time when the pressure was melody, when the deep places sang
to the surface and the surface sang back, a harmony of ley and flow, of
root and rock and ritual. A time before the fracture.</p>
<p>Then, a new pressure. Sharp. Final. A verdict.</p>
<p><em>You are the breach. You are the leak. You are the ear that hears
the wound.</em></p>
<p>Before I could form anything like a thought in response, the pressure
shifted again, violently. The cathedral of resonance convulsed. The
lonely awareness from the fracture was suddenly flooded with a new,
alien signal—a skittering, chittering, metallic pulse. It was the sound
of the city above, translated into the language of the deep. The MRT
tunnelling through bedrock. The pile drivers hammering foundations into
the ancient seabed. The ceaseless, draining suck of ten thousand
air-conditioning units, pulling heat from the surface and vomiting it
into the air. The digital chatter bleeding through the substrate.</p>
<p>It was noise. Profane, shrieking, structural noise. It clawed at the
edges of the fracture. It was not part of the old song. It was its
antithesis.</p>
<p>The awareness from the deep recoiled. The focus on me twisted into
something else. Not curiosity, but utility. The pressure shaped a
command, an imperative that was pressed into the very fabric of my
being.</p>
<p><em>Stanch the noise. Seal the breach. Mend the leak.</em></p>
<p><em>Or be unmade by it.</em></p>
<p>The unfolded world snapped back.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was on my hands and knees in the mud, vomiting salt water and bile.
The rain was a physical assault. The world was appallingly loud—the
shouts, the slop of waves, the diesel grumble of the barge engine. It
was all that metallic, skittering noise, raw and undiluted. It felt like
needles in my teeth.</p>
<p>Strong hands hooked under my arms. Arjun and one of the workers,
their faces masks of mud and alarm, hauled me backwards. My legs were
blocks of stone. They dragged me through the mire, back to the relative
solidity of the barge deck. I collapsed against the gunwale, retching
again, though nothing was left.</p>
<p>“What did you do?” Arjun’s voice was low, fierce. He crouched beside
me, his hand on my shoulder. “Rafi. Look at me. What did you
<em>do</em>?”</p>
<p>I tried to speak. My tongue was thick, foreign. I tasted mud and the
ghost of that black ichor—a taste like old metal and stagnant lotus
root. I looked at my hand. My fingertips were clean. There was no stain.
But the vibration was still there, a sub-audible drone in the core of
me. The command was there, etched into my nervous system.</p>
<p><em>Stanch the noise. Seal the breach.</em></p>
<p>I looked past him, towards the splinter of bone. The workers were
gathered at the far end of the barge, speaking in rapid, hushed Hokkien.
They were staring at the bone, but also at the water around it. I
followed their gaze.</p>
<p>The pool of ichor was spreading. Not just a slick on the surface. The
water itself, for a radius of several metres, was darkening, as if dyed
from below. Tendrils of black were reaching out through the murky tide,
delicate as ink in milk. And where the dark water met the wooden pilings
of a nearby abandoned jetty, a faint, phosphorescent shimmer clung to
the rotting wood, a sickly green-gold that pulsed in time with the hum
in my bones.</p>
<p>“I listened,” I finally said, my voice a rasp. “And it answered.”</p>
<p>“What answered?” Arjun’s grip tightened.</p>
<p>“The thing that’s broken. The thing this city is built on top of.” I
pushed myself up, my body protesting. The world tilted, then righted
itself on its new, terrible axis. “It’s not a relic, Arjun. It’s a
wound. And the city… the noise of the city is like grit in that wound.
It’s an infection.”</p>
<p>He stared at me, his practical, engineering mind warring with what he
had seen—the bone, the ichor, my reaction. “What are you talking about?
Infection? This is mud. Old bone. Strange mud, okay, but…”</p>
<p>“You felt the hum,” I said, cutting him off. “You said it was in your
fillings. That’s the breach. That’s the sound of it… leaking. Of the
deep place bleeding into ours, and our noise bleeding back into it.” The
concepts were forming into words now, clumsy and inadequate. “It’s a
two-way rupture. And it’s getting wider.”</p>
<p>One of the workers, the foreman, approached cautiously. He ignored
me, speaking directly to Arjun. “Cannot already, <em>boss</em>. This one
is not our business.” He gestured sharply at the darkening water, the
glowing pilings. “This is ** <em>pontianak</em> business. ** <em>Orang
laut</em> ghost. We move the barge. Now.”</p>
<p>Arjun looked from the man’s frightened face to the spreading stain.
He was a man of concrete and rebar, of permits and load-bearing
calculations. But he was also a man who knew that Singapore was built on
stories it had tried to bulldoze. The fear in his worker’s eyes was an
older, more potent data set.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Arjun said, decisively. “We go.” He turned to me. “We’re
leaving. Now.”</p>
<p>I didn’t argue. The imperative in me was not to stay. It was to act.
But to act, I needed to understand. I needed to know what the “noise”
was, specifically. And I needed to know how to “stanch” it. The answers
were not in the mud. They were in the city that was causing the
offence.</p>
<p>As the workers fired up the barge engine and we began to pull away
from the site, I kept my eyes on the splinter. It receded, a pale thorn
in a spreading blot of black. The hum receded with it, from a physical
vibration to a persistent, internal tinnitus. But the command did not
fade. It was a lodestone in my gut, pulling me towards the skyline now
smudged by rain in the distance.</p>
<p>The city was the problem. The beautiful, brutal, engineered city. My
home.</p>
<hr />
<p>The journey back to the river mouth was silent. The workers avoided
me. Arjun stood at the bow, his back tense, watching the water ahead as
if it might suddenly congeal into something solid. I sat against the
cabin, feeling the rain wash the mud from my jeans. It didn’t wash the
cold away. That was internal.</p>
<p>By the time we docked at the makeshift jetty near Sungei Kadut, the
rain had softened to a drizzle. The world had returned to its normal,
garish colours—the green of rampant vegetation, the rust of corrugated
roofs, the bright plastic of litter. It looked like a lie. A veneer over
the true, resonant landscape I had glimpsed.</p>
<p>Arjun helped me off the barge. My legs held. “You’re going to Auntie
Li’s?” he asked, his voice flat.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good. Sleep. Shower. Forget today.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>He met my eyes then, and I saw the conflict there. The friend who was
worried. The rational man who was terrified. “Rafi, listen to me. That
thing out there… and what you did… I have worked on sites where old
<em>keramat</em> shrines were disturbed. I have seen men get sick,
machines break for no reason. There are rules. You don’t touch. You make
an offering, you back away. You don’t <em>kneel</em> in it. You don’t
put your hand in its mouth.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a <em>keramat</em>,” I said quietly. “It was older. It’s
the reason the <em>keramat</em> were there in the first place.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, a gesture of surrender. “I don’t want to know. My
job is to fill that lot with clean soil and foundation piles. That’s
all. That’s my part of the song.” He used my word unconsciously, and
flinched at it. “Go home, Rafi.”</p>
<p>He turned and walked back towards the barge, already barking orders
to the workers to secure the vessel. The discussion was over. I was
alone again, but the aloneness was different. I was not unmoored. I was
tethered—to a wound in the mud, and to a purpose I had not chosen.</p>
<p>The walk to the main road, the wait for the bus, the ride back into
the dense heart of the island—all of it was now filtered through the new
lens. The bus’s engine was a grating snarl. The tinny music from a
teenager’s headphones was a sonic barb. The shudder of the bus as it
crossed an expansion joint on the bridge was a jolt to the fracture in
my soul. This was the noise. This was the ceaseless, grating, mechanical
dissonance that was pouring into the deep place. I felt it as an
abrasion, a psychic pollution.</p>
<p>But how did one stanch it? You couldn’t silence a city of six
million. You couldn’t un-invent the MRT, or switch off the
air-conditioning.</p>
<p><em>Auntie Li.</em> The thought surfaced, clear and cold. She was my
tether to the surface world, to the human-scale history. She knew the
stories. She knew the old maps, not of streets, but of flows and
energies. If anyone understood the concept of a breach between worlds,
it would be in the folklore she curated.</p>
<p>When I reached the shophouse on Spottiswoode Park Road, the sky was
the colour of worn slate. The blue ceramic frog was in its place. I
retrieved the key, my movements automatic. The shophouse was cool and
dark, smelling of old wood and dried herbs. Silence.</p>
<p>It was a false silence. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator, the
distant whine of a vacuum cleaner from next door, the subterranean
rumble of a train passing somewhere deep below. All of it was the noise.
I walked to the sink and turned on the tap. The gush of water was a
roar. I flinched.</p>
<p>I needed to get out of my own skin. I shed my muddy clothes, left
them in a heap on the bathroom floor, and stood under the shower. The
water was a mercy, a neutral sound. But as I closed my eyes, I saw the
ichor, the slow, purposeful droplets. I felt the pressure of the deep
place. The command echoed.</p>
<p><em>Stanch the noise.</em></p>
<p>Dressed in clean, soft clothes, I felt marginally more human. The
hollow ringing was gone, replaced by the permanent, low-grade hum. I was
the ear that hears the wound. I would never know silence again.</p>
<p>I found Auntie Li in the back courtyard, carefully watering her
collection of ferns and orchids with a small brass watering can. She
didn’t turn as I approached.</p>
<p>“You have been to a wet place,” she said, her voice neutral. “A place
of tides and forgetting.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>She finally looked at me, her eyes sharp behind her glasses. “You
carry the smell. Not of mud. Of old water. Water that has lain under the
ground for a long time. And something else. A… hollowness. Like a
seashell.” She set the watering can down. “You found your
connection.”</p>
<p>“I found a fracture,” I said, leaning against the doorframe. The
words came out in a exhausted rush. “In the Kranji mudflats. A piece of
something that shouldn’t be there. It’s bleeding, Auntie. And it’s
aware. And it’s in pain. Because of us. Because of all of this.” I
gestured vaguely upwards, at the city beyond the courtyard walls.</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment, absorbing this. She did not look
surprised. She looked resigned. “So. It is true. The old stories from
the <em>orang laut</em>. The stories my grandmother whispered, about the
Lion City’s shadow.”</p>
<p>“What shadow?”</p>
<p>“Not a shadow of buildings. A shadow in the water. A counterpart. A
foundation.” She moved to a small wooden stool and sat, motioning for me
to do the same. “You know Singapore is called the Lion City? A silly
story, from a Sumatran prince who saw a beast and called it a lion.
There are no lions here. But there are other guardians. Older ones.”</p>
<p>She folded her hands in her lap. “The story says this island is not
just land. It is a capstone. A seal. Placed over a… a deep well. A place
where the world is thin. The <em>orang laut</em>, the sea people, they
were its keepers. Their songs, their rituals, their very movements on
the water—it was a maintenance. A way of keeping the harmony between the
world above and the world below. The ‘song’ you talked about.”</p>
<p>My blood went cold. “What was in the well?”</p>
<p>She shrugged, a very Singaporean gesture of pragmatic ignorance. “Who
knows? A spirit? A dragon? A sleeping god? The source of all
<em>semangat</em>? It does not matter what it is. It matters that it is
<em>contained</em>. And that the seal requires harmony to hold.” Her
eyes grew distant. “Then the British came. Then the dredgers. The land
reclamation. The <em>orang laut</em> were moved ashore, their boats
sold. Their songs forgotten. The harmony… stopped.”</p>
<p>“And the seal cracked,” I whispered, seeing the splinter in my
mind.</p>
<p>“Perhaps. Or perhaps the noise from above—the digging, the pounding,
the screaming metal—became too great. A constant shrieking against the
capstone.” She looked at me, her gaze piercing. “You touched it.”</p>
<p>“It spoke to me. It gave me a command. To stanch the noise. To seal
the breach.”</p>
<p>Auntie Li let out a long, slow breath. “Ah. So you are not just a
listener now. You are an instrument.” She said it not with fear, but
with a weary acceptance. “This is a heavy thing.”</p>
<p>“How do I do it?” The question was a plea. “I can’t quiet a
city.”</p>
<p>“No,” she agreed. “But the noise is not uniform. The old maps—not the
street maps, but the maps of <em>qi</em>, of spirit roads—they show
places of confluence. Where the energy of the land gathers. Where the
veil is thin. The old <em>keramat</em>, the shrines, they were often
built on such spots. Not to worship, but to <em>manage</em>. To anchor
the harmony.” She stood up, her movements suddenly brisk. “Come.”</p>
<p>I followed her back into the cool gloom of the shophouse. She went to
a large, rosewood cabinet, unlocked it with a key from a chain around
her neck, and pulled out a wide, flat drawer. Inside were not papers,
but large, brittle sheets of <em>daluang</em> bark paper, covered in
intricate, hand-drawn maps.</p>
<p>“These were copied from much older sources,” she said, carefully
laying one out on the red marble table. “By a <em>bomoh</em> who worked
for Raffles himself, they say. To know where not to build.”</p>
<p>The map was a rendering of the island, but utterly alien. Singapore’s
familiar shape was there, but overlaid with a web of flowing lines,
swirls, and nodes. It was less a geography and more a diagram of a
circulatory system. There were notations in <em>Jawi</em> script. I
recognized a few landmarks—Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill, now Fort
Canning), the mouth of the Singapore River, the rocky outcrops at
Tanjong Pagar.</p>
<p>“Here,” she said, her bony finger pointing to a node where several
swirling lines converged, near the southern coast. It was marked with a
symbol that looked like a weeping eye. “A place of powerful outflow. A
place where the world below breathes into the world above.” Her finger
traced a line inland, to a corresponding node on the map, this one
marked with a symbol like a clenched fist. “And here. A place of intake.
A listening ear.”</p>
<p>“Where are they?” I asked, my heart pounding.</p>
<p>She squinted at the tiny <em>Jawi</em> notations. “The outflow… is
where the Marina Barrage is now. The intake…” Her finger tapped the fist
symbol. “This is the site of the old National Theatre. The Van Kleef
Aquarium. Places of gathering. Of sound.” She looked up. “Both are gone
now. Rebuilt. Covered in concrete.”</p>
<p>Of course they were. The city had paved over its own pressure
points.</p>
<p>“But the map shows the flows,” I insisted. “If the harmony was a
circuit, and the circuit is broken… could the noise be concentrated at
these points? If the deep place is ‘bleeding’ at the fracture in Kranji,
maybe the ‘noise’ from the city is pouring in most strongly at these
other weak spots. Amplifying the problem.”</p>
<p>Auntie Li considered this. “It is possible. If you want to stanch a
wound, you do not just put a bandage on the cut. You must also clean the
source of the infection.”</p>
<p>“So I need to go to these places. These nodes. I need to… I don’t
know. Listen. Understand what the noise is there. See if it can be…
corrected.”</p>
<p>“It is a theory,” she said, folding the map with great care. “A
dangerous one. You are not a <em>bomoh</em>. You are a man with a hole
in him, who has stuck his finger in a deeper hole. You may make things
worse.”</p>
<p>“I have a command in my head, Auntie Li. I can feel it, like a
compass needle. It’s pulling me. If I don’t follow it, I think it will
unravel me. I am the breach, too.”</p>
<p>She studied my face for what felt like an eternity. Then she nodded,
once. She handed me the folded map. “Take this. Be careful. The old
places remember their purpose, even under the concrete. They may not
welcome your interference. And the city… the city will not understand
what you are doing.”</p>
<p>I took the brittle paper. It felt charged, like it held a static of
its own. “Where should I start?”</p>
<p>“The intake,” she said. “The listening ear. The place where the
city’s noise is sucked down. Find what it is hearing. Then you will know
what you must silence.”</p>
<p>The old National Theatre. Van Kleef Aquarium. The site was now part
of the sprawling Padang, near the new Esplanade complex. The very civic
heart of modern Singapore.</p>
<p>I had my direction. The lodestone in my gut hummed in agreement.</p>
<p>As I turned to go to my room to study the map, Auntie Li spoke again,
her voice soft. “Rafi.”</p>
<p>I looked back.</p>
<p>“You asked about your mother’s song. The one she hummed. The one you
could never remember.”</p>
<p>I went still.</p>
<p>“I think you are hearing it now,” she said. “Not the melody. But the
frequency. She was listening, too. She was just… closer to the source
than was safe.”</p>
<p>She turned back to her cabinet, closing the drawer with a definitive
click. The conversation was over.</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs to my room, the map crackling in my hand. The
hum in my bones had found a focus. It was no longer a diffuse distress
signal. It was a navigation tone, leading me to the city’s hidden
ear.</p>
<p>I am home. And I am answered.</p>
<p>And the answer is a map to the places where the world is thin, and a
command to make it thick again, starting with the deafening roar of the
place where we gather to applaud.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-16-1"><strong>Chapter 16</strong></h2>
<p>The map was not a guide. It was a confession.</p>
<p>I spread it on the floor of my room, the paper sighing as it
flattened, corners held down by a half-empty water glass, my phone, a
book whose title I could no longer read. The overhead bulb, a single,
unshaded eye, cast a stark, unforgiving light. The lines were not the
crisp, confident strokes of a cartographer. They were spidery, hesitant,
a topography of anxiety. Auntie Li had not drawn roads so much as she
had traced scars.</p>
<p>And there, at the centre of the web, was the old National Theatre.
She had not drawn the building itself. She had drawn a vortex, a series
of concentric, wavering circles that bled into the Singapore River,
lapped at the edges of the Padang, and sent faint, capillary lines out
towards the vanished Van Kleef Aquarium and the skeletal outline of the
old <em>Kallang Airport</em>. It was less a site and more a wound. A
listening ear, she had called it. On the paper, it looked like a
screaming mouth.</p>
<p>The lodestone in my gut, that constant hum I had carried since the
void, pulsed in time with the drawn circles. It was not a pull anymore.
It was a resonance. I was the tuning fork, and the city was the
instrument. The realisation was cold, factual. My mother had been closer
to the source. She had listened until the song was all she could hear.
Until she was part of the frequency.</p>
<p>I had no tools for this. No holy water, no sacred chants, no blessed
knives. I had a hole in my soul where a world should be, and a command
etched into the static of that hollow space: <em>Mend the breach</em>. I
was the breach, and I was the needle. The absurdity of it was a taste
like tin foil on the tongue.</p>
<p>Sleep was impossible. The map crackled even when I wasn’t touching
it, a low, papery static that frayed the edges of the quiet. The rain
had returned, not the theatrical wall of my first night, but a
persistent, whispering drizzle that made the night outside my window a
smear of ochre streetlight and shifting shadow. I dressed in dark,
practical clothes, clothes for moving unseen. I put the map in a plastic
sleeve to protect it from the wet, though some part of me suspected the
paper was less vulnerable than I was.</p>
<p>The shophouse was a vault of sleeping breath. Auntie Li’s presence
below was a dense, watchful silence. I moved down the stairs like a
ghost, each creak of the wood a thunderclap in the hush. The front door
yielded with a click that sounded like a bone snapping. Then I was out
in the five-foot way, the covered space that was neither street nor
home, a space for waiting. Now it was a space for departure.</p>
<p>The city at three in the morning is a different incantation. The
drumming rain had softened to a mist that hung in the air, a wet gauze
that diffused the light and muffled sound. My footsteps on the pavement
were the only clear note. I walked past shuttered noodle stalls, their
metal grates down, past the 24-hour <em>kopi</em> shop where a lone man
stared into the luminous green void of a gaming monitor, past the
void-deck of an HDB block where a single fluorescent tube buzzed over
empty chess tables. Singapore slept, or pretended to sleep. Its dreams
were the silent glide of taxis, the hiss of street cleaners, the
distant, sub-aural thrum of servers in climate-controlled towers.</p>
<p>I followed the river. The map’s capillary lines seemed to align with
its flow. The Singapore River was a canal now, tamed, lit with tasteful
LEDs, its banks lined with bars that were dark and chairs stacked like
skeletal remains. But the water moved with a patient, muscular memory.
It remembered when it was a vein of trade and sewage and life, when
<em>tongkangs</em> jostled for space and the air was thick with the
smell of spice and mud. It remembered the Theatre that had been built
over its tributaries.</p>
<p>The Esplanade’s durian spines emerged from the gloom, their metallic
skins beaded with moisture. The Padang, the great green field, was a
black lake of shadow. And there, between them, was nothing. A vast,
empty expanse of paved ground, slick with rain, reflecting the orange
sodium lights of the civic district. The National Theatre was gone.
Razed. Erased. Only the memory of its shape remained, implied by the
space it did not fill.</p>
<p>But the map was right. The nothingness <em>hummed</em>.</p>
<p>I stepped off the proper path and onto the open plaza. The sound of
my footsteps changed, became hollow, echoing as if I walked on a
drumskin stretched over a cavern. The lodestone in my gut flared, a
cold, magnetic ache. I stopped in what would have been the centre of the
auditorium. The stage. The vortex on the paper.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. Not to see, but to listen past the patter of
drizzle, the distant traffic on Nicoll Highway.</p>
<p>At first, there was only the ringing in my own ears, the legacy of
the void. Then, beneath it, a pressure. Not a sound, but the shape of a
sound. The ghost of an echo. It was the roar of a crowd that was no
longer there, the crash of a symphony that had long since ended, the
forgotten lines of a thousand plays. It was civic noise, artistic noise,
the collected human sound of a nation gathering to witness itself. But
it was trapped. It had been poured into this concrete bowl and then the
bowl was smashed, but the noise had nowhere to go. It pooled here,
seeping into the land, a psychic runoff.</p>
<p>This was the intake. Not listening to the city. The city had been
listening to <em>it</em>, drinking this stagnant, recycled sound. A
feedback loop of forgotten applause.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. The mist seemed thicker here, coiling at
knee-level. The map in my hand grew warm through the plastic. The
command in my head clarified, a single, clear imperative: <em>Silence
the echo</em>.</p>
<p>But how does one silence a ghost?</p>
<p>I had no ritual. Only instinct. I knelt on the wet pavement, the cold
seeping through the fabric of my trousers. I placed my palms flat on the
ground. The concrete was vibrating, a faint, constant tremor. I thought
of my mother, humming a tune she could not have heard with her ears. I
thought of the hollow in myself. I was a vessel, empty. Perhaps that was
the tool.</p>
<p>I did not try to push the sound down. I tried to open myself to it.
To let the trapped roar flow into the hollow.</p>
<p>It hit like a tsunami.</p>
<p>A cacophony of decades flooded into me. The distinct, sharp laughter
of a woman in 1978. The collective gasp of an audience at a tragic
denouement. The thunderous ovation for a visiting dignitary. The tinny
crackle of a forgotten microphone. The rustle of a thousand programmes.
The coughs, the whispers, the shifting in seats. It was not a single
sound but a layered, sedimentary deposit of human attention. It filled
the void in me, not with substance, but with a screaming, spectral
history. My bones became tuning forks, vibrating at a thousand different
frequencies. My teeth ached. I could smell old perfume, mothballs from
evening jackets, the ozone of stage lights.</p>
<p>I was not Rafi on a wet plaza. I was a node in a network of ghostly
sensation. I saw flashes—the sweeping curves of the Theatre’s roof, the
red seats, the glare of a spotlight. I felt the nervous excitement of a
performer in the wings. I tasted the dry dust of a stage curtain.</p>
<p>And beneath it all, holding it all together like a fundamental bass
note, was the command. The one that had been woven into the fabric of
this place when it was built, the silent prayer of its architects:
<em>Gather. Unite. Applaud.</em> A civic spell. It had worked too well.
It had gathered the sound and given it nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I could not contain it. I was a small cup trying to hold an ocean.
The pressure built in my skull, a white-hot needle behind my eyes. I was
going to shatter. The noise would tear me apart and spill back out,
worse, amplified by my broken vessel.</p>
<p>Then, a different note. A thin, clear filament of sound woven through
the chaos. A hum. Not my mother’s song, but something adjacent. A
frequency of stability, of <em>grounding</em>. It was coming from beside
me.</p>
<p>With immense effort, I turned my head.</p>
<p>Auntie Li stood there. She was not in her nightclothes. She wore a
simple, dark <em>samfu</em>, and her hair was neatly pinned. In her
hands was a small, unglazed clay pot, the kind used for rooting
cuttings. She held it lightly, but her posture was one of immense
concentration. She was humming, a low, monotonous note that seemed to
vibrate in the space between her lips and the pot.</p>
<p>She did not look at me. She looked at the ground where my hands were
planted. She took a step closer, and her hum shifted pitch, just
slightly. It became a counterpoint to the roar inside me. A drain.</p>
<p>She knelt, placing the clay pot carefully on the ground next to my
knee. The pot was empty. It was a vessel, too. But it was a vessel made
for this. An anchor.</p>
<p>“Let it go,” she said, her voice barely audible over the storm in my
head. “Not into you. <em>Through</em> you. Into the earth. You are the
conduit, not the reservoir. You are the needle. Sew it shut.”</p>
<p>I understood. I stopped trying to hold the sound. I focused on the
lodestone in my gut, on the command to mend. I imagined myself not as a
cup, but as a needle, a silver stitch. The roaring, ghostly noise was
the torn thread. I let it flow into me, and with a wrenching effort of
will, I pushed it <em>down</em>, through my bones, through my palms,
into the wet concrete, into the soil and the forgotten waterways
beneath.</p>
<p>The clay pot began to ring, a high, pure tone like a struck glass.
The noise pouring out of me met Auntie Li’s grounding hum and was
funneled, focused, into the earth. It was not erased. It was returned.
The applause went back to the hands that had made it. The music
dissolved into the molecules of the air that had carried it. The words
evaporated into the night from which they’d come.</p>
<p>It took an age. The pressure slowly ebbed. The visions faded. The
cold ache in my hands became just the cold of wet concrete. The ringing
in the clay pot softened, then ceased.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>A real, profound silence. The mist on the Padang had cleared. The
drizzle had stopped. The city sounds—a distant siren, the hum of the
Esplanade’s machinery—returned, but they were ordinary now. They were
not feeding into a hungry, silent mouth beneath the civic skin.</p>
<p>I slumped forward, catching myself on my hands. I was drenched in
sweat and rain, trembling with exhaustion. My head felt scooped-out,
clean.</p>
<p>Auntie Li picked up the clay pot. It was warm. A fine web of cracks
now covered its surface. It had held, but just barely. She looked at me,
her face etched with a deep weariness. “You see? It is not magic. It is
acoustics. Spiritual acoustics. The city is full of poorly designed
rooms. Rooms that trap sound. Rooms that amplify whispers into screams.”
She helped me to my feet. My legs were water.</p>
<p>“You followed me,” I croaked.</p>
<p>“You are a lodestone,” she said simply. “You are easy to follow. And
you are a fool. A brave fool. You tried to drink the sea.”</p>
<p>“It’s quieter now,” I said. The relief was a physical thing, a
lightness in my chest.</p>
<p>“This ear is closed,” she agreed, looking around the empty plaza.
“But the map has other marks. Other… poorly designed rooms. The
aquarium. The airport. The cinema at Bras Basah. Each with its own
trapped frequency. Each a leak in the dam.” She handed me the cracked
clay pot. “Keep this. You will need to learn to make your own anchors.
The next one may not have me to bring you a pot.”</p>
<p>I took it. It was still warm, a tiny hearth in my hands. “Why?” I
asked. The question was vast. Why help me? Why this? Why her?</p>
<p>She began to walk, leading me off the plaza, back towards the living
city. “Your mother was my friend. She heard the song, and it fascinated
her. She went looking for the singer. I heard the song, and it
frightened me. I learned how to mute it. We make our choices.” She
glanced at me. “You did not choose the song. But you are choosing the
needle. That is a different thing.”</p>
<p>We walked in silence for a block. The sky was beginning to pale at
the edges, a thin, grey dilution of the night. “What was trapped at the
aquarium?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not sound,” she said. Her pace slowed. “Sight. The relentless,
circular witness of thousands of captive eyes. A different kind of
pressure. A visual echo.” She stopped, turning to face me. Her
expression was grim. “That one… that one is more dangerous. Sound
dissipates. Sight can be reflected. It can get inside you and show you
things you cannot unsee. The command there is not <em>mend</em>. It is
<em>forget</em>.”</p>
<p>The cracked pot in my hands felt suddenly heavier. The lodestone in
my gut, quiet now, gave a faint, dull throb. Not a pull towards the next
point, but a tremor of warning.</p>
<p>I had silenced an echo. The next task was to blind a memory.</p>
<p>Auntie Li touched my arm, a brief, dry contact. “Go home. Sleep. The
map will wait. And you must learn to make a lid for the well before you
look into it.”</p>
<p>She melted into the pre-dawn gloom, heading not towards Spottiswoode
Park, but in another direction entirely. I was left alone on the empty
street, holding a broken pot, the taste of old applause still like dust
in my mouth.</p>
<p>The first breach was sealed. The hollow in me was no longer just an
emptiness. It was a tool that had been used, a channel that had been
scoured. It ached, but it ached with purpose.</p>
<p>I turned towards home, the first birds beginning their tentative
calls in the trees along the river. The city was waking up, oblivious.
It would never know that a piece of its ghostly, screaming
infrastructure had been dismantled in the night. It would feel only,
perhaps, a slight lessening of a tension it had never known it
carried.</p>
<p>But I knew. And the map in my pocket, with its other vortexes, its
other scars, was a ledger of work yet to do. The Van Kleef Aquarium
awaited. A place of silent, swimming witnesses and a command not to
mend, but to forget.</p>
<p>I am the needle. And the next stitch must be blind.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-17-1"><strong>Chapter 17</strong></h2>
<p>The Van Kleef Aquarium was a ghost long before it closed. It sat on
the edge of the Singapore River, a low, brutalist block of stained
concrete and glass that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.
In the flat, hard glare of mid-morning, it looked like a bunker. A place
built to withstand siege, not to display the delicate, darting lives of
fish. The river water here moved with a thick, green languor, smelling
of diesel and the deep, organic rot of forgotten things. The city had
grown sleek towers around it, glass giants that turned their backs on
the squat, ugly building, as if embarrassed by its persistent, crumbling
memory.</p>
<p>I stood across the road, under the shade of a raintree. The pot from
the theatre was back in my room, wrapped in a cloth, its silence now a
familiar, quiet companion. The lodestone in my gut was not quiet. It was
a slow, cold swirl, like oil on water. It did not pull. It watched.</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s words were a grit in my mind. <em>A visual echo. The
relentless, circular witness of thousands of captive eyes.</em></p>
<p>I had come to look, not to act. To learn the shape of the well before
I tried to cap it. The command was <em>forget</em>. I did not know what
that meant. Forgetting is not an action; it is an absence. You cannot
<em>do</em> forgetting. You can only be emptied.</p>
<p>The main entrance was sealed with a rusted steel gate and a laminated
notice from the Singapore Land Authority, the print faded to ghosts of
words. But memory, I was learning, has more than one door. A service
alley ran down the western side, choked with discarded PVC pipes and the
skeletons of office chairs. Halfway down, a ground-level window was
boarded not with plywood, but with a warped sheet of corrugated metal,
one corner pried up and bent back with the patience of rust. A dark
mouth exhaling air that was several degrees cooler, and carried the
unmistakable, briny tang of stale saltwater.</p>
<p>The hollow in me flexed, a soft, acknowledging pulse.</p>
<p>I waited for a delivery van to rumble past, for the street to lapse
back into its humid stupor. Then I crossed, slipped into the alley’s
shadow, and knelt before the opening. The bent metal scraped against
concrete with a sound like a dry cough. The space beneath was just large
enough. I pushed my bag through first, then wriggled after it, the
concrete catching at my shirt, the cool, damp air closing over my skin
like a sheath.</p>
<p>Inside, the darkness was not complete. Fingers of daylight stabbed
through cracks in other boarded windows, through broken panes high in
the ceiling, illuminating swirling galaxies of dust. I was in a long,
narrow service corridor. The walls were painted a dismal green to
shoulder height, then a cream that had yellowed like old teeth. Pipes
ran overhead, insulated with foam that hung in tattered, blackened
strips. The floor was gritty with broken plaster and the crumbled
remains of ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>And the silence. It was not the silence of the theatre, that tense,
anticipatory hush. This was a thick, wet silence. A drowned silence. It
pressed against my eardrums, a physical weight. The hollow in me stirred
again, not in hunger, but in recognition. This place was full.
Oppressively full. But what it was full of was not sound.</p>
<p>I followed the corridor, my footsteps the only breach in the quiet,
absurdly loud. It opened into the main concourse.</p>
<p>The vast space stopped me. A cathedral of decay. The ceiling was a
vault of exposed concrete ribs and rusted metal trusses. The far wall
was one great, curving window, twenty feet high, looking into the
principal tank. The glass was a cataract, clouded with algae and mineral
deposits, a greasy, greenish film that blurred the world beyond it into
a murky dream. Faint, shifting light penetrated from the river side,
painting the interior of the hall in aqueous, wavering patterns. It felt
less like a room and more like the belly of a ship that had sunk into
very deep, very still water.</p>
<p>Smaller display tanks lined the walls to my left and right, their
glass smashed or so thickly coated with grime they were opaque. Their
frames were rusted scabs. Here and there, a pale, plastic castle or a
synthetic frond of seaweed lay amidst the debris on the floor, toys in a
forgotten nursery.</p>
<p>But it was the big tank that commanded the space. That demanded
witness.</p>
<p>I walked towards it, my neck craning back. The clouded glass gave
nothing away. It was a wall of secret, stagnant green. I pressed my palm
against it. It was shockingly cold, and damp condensed instantly around
my skin. I leaned in, peering, trying to see past the veil of algae.</p>
<p>A shape moved.</p>
<p>Vast, grey, and slow. It drifted parallel to the glass, a spectral
leviathan in the gloom. My breath hitched. It was a concrete replica of
a whale shark, suspended on thick, corroded cables from the ceiling of
the tank. Its paint was peeling, its blank eye a dark socket. It hung
there, a monument to a failure of imagination, turning in some
infinitesimal current of air.</p>
<p>The lodestone went still. Then it turned over, a slow, sickening
roll.</p>
<p>I understood. The echo here was not in the water. It was in the
glass. The glass was the membrane. For decades, living eyes had pressed
against this side, wide with wonder or boredom or a child’s fleeting
curiosity. And on the other side, thousands upon thousands of captive
eyes had looked back. Fish eyes, round and unblinking. The stare of
groupers, passive and ancient. The frantic, skittering gaze of sardines
in a shimmering school. The cold, assessing regard of a shark. An
unbroken circuit of seeing and being seen. A perpetual, silent exchange
of witness.</p>
<p>When the living left and the fish died or were taken away, the
circuit did not break. It shorted. The glass remembered. It held the
imprint of all that looking. A visual resonance trapped in a transparent
medium, replaying forever. Not an image, but the <em>act</em> of sight
itself. The pressure of being watched. The weight of being a
spectacle.</p>
<p><em>A visual echo.</em></p>
<p>I took a step back from the glass. The hollow in me was no longer a
channel; it felt like a lens. I could feel the pressure of the
accumulated gaze beginning to focus. It was not directed at me yet. It
was simply <em>on</em>, a beam searching for a retina to land upon.</p>
<p>A soft click echoed through the hall.</p>
<p>I froze. The sound had not come from the tank. It had come from the
shadows near a broken turnstile, leading to what might have been a gift
shop.</p>
<p>“You feel it, don’t you?”</p>
<p>The voice was male, calm, and educated. It came from the darkness,
and a moment later, a man stepped into a shard of light. He was in his
late fifties, perhaps, dressed in neat khaki trousers and a faded polo
shirt. His hair was thin, grey, swept back. He held a large,
professional-looking torch, but it was switched off. In his other hand,
he held a small, leather-bound notebook.</p>
<p>“Most people just get a headache,” he said, moving closer. His eyes
were pale, sharp behind wire-framed glasses. “A sense of being crowded.
They leave quickly. But you… you walked right to the epicentre. You put
your hand on the glass.” He stopped a polite distance away. “You’re not
here for urban exploration.”</p>
<p>The lodestone was a hard, cold knot. This was not part of the map.
“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Aris Thorne.” He said it not with pride, but with a weary
precision. “I was the senior marine biologist here. For the last eight
years of its operation.” He looked past me at the clouded tank, his
expression one of profound, intimate sadness. “I tried to save them, you
know. The specimens. When they decided to close, the proposal was to…
euthanise most of the larger animals. Ship a few to other facilities. I
fought it. I lost.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Are you?” He looked at me directly, and his gaze had the same
quality as the echo in the glass: assessing, patient, trapped. “You’re
here for the resonance. The <em>nodus</em>.”</p>
<p>The word hung in the damp air. A clinical term. A pin to stick in a
butterfly.</p>
<p>“What do you call it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A psychic scar. A cognitive feedback loop.” He tapped his temple.
“I’ve been studying it since I realised what was happening. The last
year we were open, the staff attrition rate was ninety percent.
Unexplained migraines. Aphasia. Nightmares featuring… overwhelming
perspectives. Visitors reported sudden, intense claustrophobia.
Paranoia. The feeling of being stared at from inside their own
heads.”</p>
<p>He walked past me, right up to the tank, and placed his own palm on
the glass, mirroring my earlier gesture. “It’s the eyes. The optic nerve
is a biological cable. It transmits electrical impulses. But on a
fundamental level, it transmits <em>attention</em>. And attention leaves
a mark. This place…” He leaned his forehead against the cold glass.
“This place is a flytrap for attention. It soaked it up for decades. Now
it broadcasts it back, on a loop. A silent, screaming stare.”</p>
<p>I thought of the theatre, the screaming trapped in the mortar. “You
know about these things. These… echoes.”</p>
<p>“I know this one.” He pushed off from the glass and turned to face
me. “I’ve mapped its boundaries. Its intensity peaks at the central
tank, but it permeates the entire structure. It is, in my hypothesis,
strengthening. As the physical structure decays, the non-physical
imprint becomes more… assertive.” He opened his notebook, showed me a
page of neat, precise diagrams—energy fields, wave patterns. “I have
developed a damping theory. A counter-resonance. But it requires a
catalyst. A focus.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and his pale eyes were no longer just sad. They were
hungry. “You are a focus. I felt the disturbance last night. Over at the
old theatre. A sharp, concussive quieting. And then you appear here, the
next day, drawn to the next major locus. You are not a researcher. You
are a practitioner.”</p>
<p>The word was a key turning in a lock. Practitioner. It sounded so
sterile. So safe.</p>
<p>“Auntie Li sent you,” I said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>He smiled, a thin, humourless stretching of lips. “Madam Li and I
have an understanding. I provide the science. She provides the…
metaphysics. And the access to individuals with the requisite empathic
hollow.” He took a step closer. “You have the hollow. I have the method.
Together, we can cap this well. Not with superstition. With applied
parapsychology.”</p>
<p>The lodestone throbbed, a warning beat. This was wrong. Auntie Li had
spoken of a command: <em>forget</em>. This man spoke of damping, of
counter-waves. He spoke of the echo as a problem to be solved, not a
memory to be released.</p>
<p>“What is your method?” My voice was quieter than the silence.</p>
<p>He gestured with his torch towards a door marked ‘Filtration &amp;
Pump Control’. “The resonance is anchored in the glass, but it is
amplified by the architecture. The circular sightlines. The reflective
surfaces. My calculations indicate that by introducing a specific,
discordant frequency at the three main structural nodes, we can collapse
the feedback loop. Shatter the echo.”</p>
<p>“Shatter it,” I repeated. “And what happens to the sight that’s
trapped? The witness?”</p>
<p>“Dissipated. Neutralised.” He said it like he was discussing a
chemical reaction.</p>
<p>But Auntie Li had said <em>forget</em>. Not destroy. To forget is an
act of mercy. To shatter is an act of violence. The hollow in me knew
the difference. It had been used to mend a scream, to give it an end. It
recoiled at the idea of shattering a memory.</p>
<p>“I need to see it,” I heard myself say. “The echo. Properly. Before
anything is done.”</p>
<p>Dr. Thorne’s eyebrows rose. “That is exceptionally unwise. To look
directly at the compiled gaze is to risk a profound psychic
retrojection. You could lose your sense of self in a million borrowed
perspectives. You could go blind.”</p>
<p>“I still need to see.”</p>
<p>He studied me for a long moment, then sighed, a sound of academic
disappointment. “Very well. The catalyst must be willing. Come. The best
vantage is from the old viewing gallery. Above the tank.”</p>
<p>He led me through the control room door, into a labyrinth of dripping
pipes and dead control panels with buttons like blind eyes. A metal
staircase, slick with condensation, spiralled upwards. We emerged onto a
narrow gantry that ran in a U-shape around the top of the big tank,
looking down into it. The fake whale shark hung below us, a grey
tombstone. From up here, the greenish light from the river window was
stronger, illuminating the water that still filled the tank—a deep,
stagnant broth of neglect.</p>
<p>“Stand there,” Thorne said, pointing to the centre of the gantry.
“Look down. Do not try to look <em>away</em>. Let the gaze find you. I
will observe from here.” He switched on his torch, not to illuminate,
but I saw he had a small digital recorder clipped to his notebook. He
was going to document this.</p>
<p>I moved to the spot. The railing was cold and wet under my hands. I
looked down into the murky water, at the suspended concrete shark, at
the filth-streaked walls of the tank.</p>
<p>I opened the hollow.</p>
<p>It was not like opening a valve. It was like removing a lens cap. The
internal emptiness ceased to be a receptor and became a conduit.</p>
<p>The pressure in the room changed. The thick, wet silence congealed.
Then, the glass of the tank below me seemed to <em>shimmer</em>. Not
with light, but with a sudden, terrifying depth. It was no longer a
barrier. It was a window into a vast, collective eye.</p>
<p>And it looked up.</p>
<p>It was not a single stare. It was a kaleidoscope, a torrent. The
placid, round eye of a giant grouper, seeing nothing but the endless,
blue-walled world. The frantic, black pinpricks of a school of
anchovies, seeing motion and shadow and the flash of silver sides. The
flat, ancient eye of a ray, seeing the sandy floor drift past. The cold,
conical eye of a barracuda, seeing prey, always prey. And human eyes,
wide and small, pressed against the other side: a child’s wonder, a
tourist’s bored glance, a lover’s distracted gaze.</p>
<p>Thousands of moments of seeing, layered, compressed, and played at
once. A deafening visual shout.</p>
<p>It poured into the hollow. It was not images, but the raw
<em>experience</em> of sight—perspective, focus, attention, fear,
boredom, hunger. I was a grouper in a blue prison. I was a child
pointing a sticky finger. I was a sardine turning as one with the
school. I was a biologist, noting faded colours with a clinical despair.
The perspectives crashed over me, through me, each fighting for
dominance. My own vision blurred, doubled, fractured into a hundred
sightlines. I saw the gantry from below. I saw the river from inside the
tank. I saw my own face, pale and stricken, from a dozen different
angles and through a dozen different kinds of eyes.</p>
<p>The command rose from the chaos, not in words, but as a desperate,
silent need: <em>FORGET</em>.</p>
<p>Forget the prison. Forget the staring faces. Forget the slow passage
of identical days. Forget the feel of artificial current. Forget the
shadow of the concrete shark. Let it all be a dream, unremembered,
dissolving into the dark.</p>
<p>But Thorne’s theory was wrong. The echo didn’t want to be shattered.
It wanted to be <em>released</em>. It wanted the mercy of oblivion.</p>
<p>A hand gripped my arm. Thorne’s voice, sharp and close. “Fascinating!
Your biofield is spiking. You’re drawing the resonance into a coherent
stream! Hold it. <em>Hold it</em>! This is the catalyst state!”</p>
<p>He was pulling me back, away from the railing. My own sight snapped
back into place, a painful, singular focus. The torrent of borrowed
vision receded to a screaming background hum. I was panting, my nails
digging into the rusted metal.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said, his eyes alight with a fervent, clinical joy. “While
you are acting as a focal point, I can apply the damping frequency at
the nodes. The feedback loop will overload. It will be magnificent.”</p>
<p>He let go of me and hurried along the gantry to a small metal box he
had evidently pre-installed. He flipped a switch. A low, electronic hum
joined the wet silence, a teeth-vibrating thrum that felt utterly alien
in this place of organic memory.</p>
<p>The lodestone in my gut went cold. Then it <em>pulled</em>.</p>
<p>It was not a pull towards a place. It was a pull against an action. A
deep, instinctual <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>The hum from Thorne’s device intensified. The shimmer in the glass
below grew jagged, frantic. The collective gaze I’d channelled wasn’t
dissipating. It was being <em>torn</em>. The command of <em>forget</em>
was being twisted into a scream of rupture.</p>
<p>I saw it then. Thorne didn’t want to heal the scar. He wanted to
study the explosion. I was not a partner. I was a probe.</p>
<p>“Stop,” I said, but my voice was a rasp, lost in the electronic
drone.</p>
<p>He didn’t hear me. He was adjusting a dial, reading a meter on his
device.</p>
<p>The hollow in me, still wide open, reacted. It had been made to mend.
To give silence to sound. It recognised this electronic thrum as a new
kind of violence. And it did not channel the echo away from me. It did
something else.</p>
<p>It reflected.</p>
<p>The torrent of trapped sight, the desperate need to <em>forget</em>,
hit the invasive, shattering frequency of Thorne’s device—and the hollow
bounced it back. Not at the tank. At the source.</p>
<p>Thorne gasped. His glasses fell from his face, clattering on the
gantry. He staggered back, his hands flying to his eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you…? The patterns… they’re inside…” His voice was a
whisper of utter terror.</p>
<p>He was seeing it. Not studying it. <em>Living</em> it. The entire,
compressed, decades-long loop of captive witness was flooding into him,
unfiltered, unmediated by the hollow’s mercy. He was the grouper, the
child, the sardine, the biologist, all at once, with no centre to hold
onto. His own scientific gaze was being swallowed by the million-eyed
stare.</p>
<p>He screamed. A short, sharp sound that was cut off as his knees hit
the metal walkway. He curled into a fetal position, his hands clamped
over his eyes, moaning.</p>
<p>I slammed the hollow shut. The connection severed. The electronic hum
from his device sputtered and died. The shimmer in the glass faded back
to a mere, greasy film.</p>
<p>The silence returned, heavier than before.</p>
<p>I walked over to him. He was shaking, his breaths coming in ragged
hitches. “Too many,” he whimpered. “Too many eyes. Can’t… can’t find
mine.”</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s warning. <em>It can get inside you and show you things
you cannot unsee.</em></p>
<p>I had not looked away. I had let it in, and the hollow had processed
it, translated its agony. Thorne had tried to force it, and it had
broken him. He had been blinded, not by darkness, but by a surplus of
sight.</p>
<p>I left him there, moaning on the gantry. There was nothing in my
practice for this. No command to mend a shattered observer.</p>
<p>Down in the main hall, the tank loomed, silent once more. But the
command within it was clearer now. It was not for me. The
<em>forget</em> was not a spell I could cast. It was the echo’s own
deepest wish. My role was not to act upon it, but to <em>listen</em> to
that wish. To acknowledge it. Perhaps that was the lid for the well: not
a cap of stone, but an act of profound, final witness that allowed the
thing witnessed to finally close its own eyes.</p>
<p>The map in my pocket was a ledger. The aquarium was a scar that
wanted to fade. Thorne’ science was a scalpel where a whisper was
needed.</p>
<p>I exited through the broken window, back into the alley’s heat and
the river’s rotten smell. The world was glaringly bright, painfully
singular. My own eyes felt raw, newly grateful for their simple,
solitary point of view.</p>
<p>But as I walked, a new sensation began. A faint, familiar pull. Not
from the lodestone. From my hands. A faint, tingling warmth where they
had gripped the gantry railing.</p>
<p>I looked down at my palms. There was no mark. But the feeling was
there. A gentle, insistent tugging, like a string tied to a finger,
leading away from the river, back towards the heart of the city.</p>
<p>The hollow was quiet. The work at the aquarium was unfinished, but
its nature had changed. Thorne was a complication I had not
foreseen.</p>
<p>And now, something else was calling. Not a scream. Not a stare. A
pull on the hands. A tactile echo.</p>
<p>The needle felt the next thread. It was not sound. It was not sight.
It was touch. And it was waiting, somewhere in the heat, to be felt.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-18-1"><strong>Chapter 18</strong></h2>
<p>The pull in my hands was a new grammar. The hollow had always
translated sound into pressure, a resonance in the bone. This was
different. It was a direct, physical tether, a line of silent tension
running from the centre of my palms into the city’s grid. It did not
throb. It did not ache. It was a constant, gentle insistence, like the
tug of a child who has taken your hand and will not be ignored.</p>
<p>I walked. The afternoon was a steam bath, the air thick with the
memory of the morning’s rain and the promise of more. The river’s stink
faded, replaced by the layered stenches of a thousand lunches being
fried, of diesel, of the sweet, cloying decay of flowers in the <em>pak
khaw</em> market. My hands led. They turned me left at the mouth of Amoy
Street, right onto Telok Ayer. The city was a riot of colour and noise,
but I moved through it like a needle through felt, following a thread
only I could feel.</p>
<p>It was not a seeking. It was a being-led.</p>
<p>I thought of Thorne, broken on the gantry. His science had been a
form of deafness. He had tried to shout down a well, to command an echo.
The echo had shouted back, with light. A surplus of sight. My own
method—the hollow, the listening—had spared me that. But it had changed
me. The aquarium’s silent scream had been processed, metabolised, and
this new sensitivity in my hands was the residue. The hollow had learned
a new sense. It had tasted the texture of a place’s pain, and now my
skin remembered the flavour.</p>
<p>The pull led me away from the shophouses, into the canyon of Tanjong
Pagar. Glass and steel towers rose, their surfaces mirroring the bruised
sky. The thread ran straight through them. I passed the mouths of MRT
stations, streams of people pouring out, their faces slick with the
humidity, eyes fixed on phones. I was a ghost moving against the
current, my attention turned inward to a map of tension in my
tendons.</p>
<p>It ended at a building. Not a heritage shophouse, not a cursed
aquarium. A modern condominium, twenty storeys of blue-green glass and
pale concrete. <em>The Clift</em>. It stood at the edge of the district,
aloof. The thread did not point to the main doors. It angled sharply,
leading down the service lane beside it, to a discreet, recessed
entrance marked <em>Delivery &amp; Utilities</em>.</p>
<p>The door was propped open with a brick. Inside, a loading bay, empty
but for a pallet of water bottles. The air was cool, humming with the
bass note of central air-conditioning. The pull in my hands intensified,
becoming a distinct downward pressure. <em>Below</em>.</p>
<p>I found the service stairs. My footsteps echoed on bare concrete. One
flight down. Then another. The light grew dimmer, the hum of the
building’s machinery louder—the groan of pumps, the whir of fans. The
stairwell opened onto a basement level. A corridor lit by flickering
fluorescents, lined with doors: <em>Electrical</em>, <em>HVAC</em>,
<em>Storage B</em>.</p>
<p>The pull was a fist now, clenching around my own. It led to the last
door, unmarked. The handle was cold. It turned. The door opened onto
darkness and a smell that stopped my breath.</p>
<p>Not rot. Not decay. Something cleaner, sharper. The mineral tang of
ozone, like after a lightning strike, undercut with the dry, papery
scent of static. And beneath that, the faintest whisper of sandalwood
incense.</p>
<p>I stepped inside. My eyes adjusted. It was a small, square room, a
forgotten utility space. The floor was concrete, the walls bare. But in
the centre of the room, someone had drawn a circle. Not with chalk or
paint. It was inscribed into the concrete itself, a groove perhaps an
inch deep, perfect in its geometry. Within the circle, the floor was
scuffed, worn smooth in patches, as if from pacing.</p>
<p>And in the circle, sitting cross-legged, was a man.</p>
<p>He was perhaps sixty, thin, wearing simple cotton trousers and a
white singlet. His eyes were closed. His hands rested on his knees,
palms up. He was utterly still. But the air around him was not. It
shimmered, a heat-haze distortion that had nothing to do with
temperature. The ozone smell was strongest here, emanating from him,
from the circle.</p>
<p>The pull in my hands released. The tension snapped, leaving a phantom
ache. This was the source. This silent man in a basement, sitting in a
ring of carved stone.</p>
<p>I did not speak. I leaned against the doorframe, waiting. The hollow
was quiet, but my skin prickled with the charged air. This was not a
place of echo. This was a place of containment. The circle was not a
summoning. It was a prison.</p>
<p>After a long minute, his eyes opened. They were a pale, watery brown.
They focused on me without surprise, as if he had been expecting me, as
if my arrival was a scheduled event.</p>
<p>“You feel it,” he said. His voice was raspy, unused. “The
leakage.”</p>
<p>I looked at my palms, then back at him. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“A side effect.” He unfolded his legs, stood with a stiffness that
spoke of hours, days, in that position. He was shorter than I’d thought.
“Of trying not to feel anything else. You are the listener. The one from
the aquarium.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a question. I said nothing.</p>
<p>“He tried to make it a tool,” the man said, nodding slightly, as if I
had confirmed everything. “Thorne. The scientist. He thought the
resonance could be harnessed. Measured. He was a fool. But a useful
fool. He led me to the site. And now, he has led you to me.” He took a
step forward, but stopped at the very edge of the inscribed circle. He
did not cross it. “My name is Arif.”</p>
<p>“What are you containing?” I asked. The spiritual seeking was not
mine, here. It was his. I was just the witness his practice had
inadvertently called.</p>
<p>“Myself.” He said it simply. He held up his hands. They were
ordinary, lined. “I was a <em>bomoh</em>. Not the theatrical kind you
see in Geylang for love spells. A real one. My family line… we dealt
with attachments. Spirits that cling. Places that remember too much. We
would listen. We would negotiate. We would… release.”</p>
<p>He looked at the circle around his feet. “The method is absorption.
You take the clinging thing into your own vessel. You hold it within
you, where it is safe, where it can be calmed. Then, slowly, you let it
dissipate. Like breath on a mirror.” He looked at me, his gaze sharp.
“You understand. Your hollow. It is a similar principle. But you are a
translator. I was a prison.”</p>
<p>“Was?”</p>
<p>“The aquarium,” he said, and the ozone smell spiked, sharp and
electric. “Thorne had stirred it up. Made it frantic. It was a big
thing. An old, collective pain. I went to help. To absorb the… the
screaming stare, as you call it.” He smiled, a thin, bitter stretch of
lips. “I was arrogant. I thought my vessel was strong enough. I took it
in. All of it.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, remembering. “It was too much. Too sharp. Too
many points of view. It was not a single ghost. It was the ghost of a
place where too many things had ended in terror. I could not hold it. I
could not begin to let it go. It would have unspooled through me, into
the world. A psychic shockwave.”</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and gestured to the circle. “So I made this. A
feedback loop. I sat in the centre. I drew the pain into me, and the
circle pushed it back into me. A closed system. A perfect containment. I
am the well. And I am the lid.”</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking had turned into a self-immolation. He had
sought to heal a scar by becoming the scar tissue.</p>
<p>“The pull I felt,” I said. “The leakage.”</p>
<p>“A crack,” he nodded. “The system is not perfect. Energy escapes. Not
the memory itself—not the images, the sounds. The <em>effort</em> of
holding it. The static. The ozone. It leaks out as a… a call for
grounding. For a conductor.” He looked at my hands. “You felt it as
touch. Your method is attuned to pressure. You felt the pressure of my
holding.”</p>
<p>“Thorne is blind,” I said.</p>
<p>Arif’s face showed a flicker of something—regret, or grim
satisfaction. “He looked directly into the sun. The release, when I
first contained it, was… bright. He was in the wrong place. A
casualty.”</p>
<p>“And the echo? The thing in the tank?”</p>
<p>“It is quiet now,” Arif said. “It is here. With me. It is no longer a
scream. It is a weight. I have given it a single point to focus on. Me.
It is simpler for it now. And for the world.” He took a deep, shuddering
breath. “This is my service now. To sit. To hold. Until I die. Then… the
circle will break. And it will flood out. But that is a problem for
another day.”</p>
<p>I understood then the false victory. At the aquarium, I had believed
I’d found the answer: witness, not command. I had seen Thorne’s hubris
shattered. I had felt I’d grasped a deeper truth. But I had only seen
the first act. The true resolution had already happened, here in this
basement. Arif had performed the ultimate act of witness—he had
<em>become</em> the memory. He had not solved the problem. He had taken
it upon himself, permanently.</p>
<p>My revelation was a child’s understanding. His was a life
sentence.</p>
<p>“Why did you call me here?” I asked. The pull had been intentional. A
leak is still a signal.</p>
<p>“To see,” he said. “To know the cost. And because the leakage… it is
getting worse. The crack is widening. I cannot repair it from inside.
The circle is both my prison and my sustainer. To break it is to release
everything, prematurely.”</p>
<p>He took a step closer to the edge. The shimmering air around him
intensified. “You are a different kind of vessel. You do not hold. You
channel. You translate. You could… siphon the leakage. Not the core
weight—that would destroy you as it would have destroyed me. But the
static. The excess pressure. You could ground it. Dissipate it into the
world quietly, through your hollow, where it would be harmless. It would
give me more time. It would keep the system stable.”</p>
<p>The proposal hung in the ozone-tinged air. He was not asking for
rescue. He was asking for maintenance. For a caretaker for his eternal
vigil.</p>
<p>“What would it do to me?” My voice was flat.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” he admitted. “It is not memory. It is the friction
of memory. It might… attune you further. It might wear grooves in your
spirit. It is a burden of a different kind.”</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking had led here, to a choice between two types of
sacrifice: his absolute, or my incremental. There was no victory. Only
different shapes of bearing.</p>
<p>I looked at the circle, at the man inside it. He had sought the
deepest possible union with a wound. He had found it. And now he was
drowning in it, asking for a rope that was also an anchor.</p>
<p>“How?” I asked.</p>
<p>He pointed to a spot on the floor, just outside the circle. “Sit
there. Put your hands on the line. The inscription. Let the hollow open.
Not to listen. To… receive. To earth.”</p>
<p>I moved slowly. The concrete was cool through my trousers. I sat
facing him, the carved groove between us. I placed my palms flat on the
floor, my fingertips just touching the outer edge of the circle.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. I did not need to drop a stone. The well was
already here. I simply removed the lid from my own hollow.</p>
<p>It was not a sound that rushed in.</p>
<p>It was a vibration. A pure, searing frequency of effort. The strain
of a mind holding a continent of grief. It was the scream of a muscle
that cannot relax. It had no images, no words. It was the essence of
<em>holding</em>. It flooded up through my hands, into my arms, a
current of sheer, taut will.</p>
<p>My teeth clenched. My bones hummed. It was not painful in the usual
sense. It was <em>loud</em> in a way that had nothing to do with ears.
The hollow, accustomed to processing specific echoes, scrambled. It was
not translating. It was being used as a drain.</p>
<p>I felt Arif’s relief. A slight softening of the terrible tension. The
ozone smell lessened, just a fraction. The shimmer in the air
subsided.</p>
<p>And into me flowed the static.</p>
<p>It did not stay. The hollow, true to its nature, could not hold it.
It passed through me, this neutralised energy of containment, and bled
out. I felt it dissipate into the floor, into the air of the basement,
becoming nothing. A sigh into a sigh.</p>
<p>But the passage left a mark. A resonance. A new sensitivity. When I
finally pulled my hands back, breaking the contact, the world felt
different. The hum of the building’s HVAC was not just a sound; I felt
its vibration in my molars. The flicker of the fluorescent light was a
physical pulse against my skin. My sense of touch had been amplified,
made porous. I could feel the texture of the air, the pressure of the
basement around me.</p>
<p>I was not a prison. I had become a tuning fork.</p>
<p>Arif was watching me, his expression one of profound, weary
gratitude. “Thank you,” he whispered. The word seemed to cost him.</p>
<p>“How often?” My voice sounded strange to me, layered with the ghost
of that vibrational hum.</p>
<p>“When the pull finds you,” he said. “It will. Now that you have
connected, the leak will find its path. It will guide you back.” He
settled back into his cross-legged position. “You have not finished the
aquarium’s business. You have simply taken over its… upkeep.”</p>
<p>The false victory was complete. I had not resolved the haunting. I
had enrolled in its eternal maintenance. Thorne’s science had broken. My
spiritual insight had revealed not a solution, but a chain of custody.
And I had just added my name to the list.</p>
<p>I stood up. My legs were unsteady. The amplified world was
overwhelming. The coarse texture of my own shirt against my neck was a
roar.</p>
<p>“What happens if I don’t come back?” I asked.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, returning to his vigil. “The crack widens. The
static becomes a shriek. Someone else will feel it. Someone like Thorne.
Or worse. And one day, the circle will fail before I die. And the old
scream will return to the aquarium, fresh and hungry, looking for new
eyes to blind.”</p>
<p>He said no more. The conversation was over. I was dismissed.</p>
<p>I left him there, in his silent, shimmering cell. The service stairs
felt like a climb out of a tomb. When I pushed open the door to the
service lane, the humid assault of the late afternoon was a physical
blow. The noise of the city was a wall of textured sound I could feel on
my face.</p>
<p>I walked, aimless at first. The pull was gone. In its place was a
new, pervasive awareness. I could feel the subway running deep below the
street, a distant thunder in my soles. I could feel the press of the
towering buildings, not as sight, but as a subtle pressure on my
eardrums. The hollow was quiet, but my whole body was now an echo
chamber for the world’s vibrations.</p>
<p>I had sought a deeper truth. I had found a deeper service. A life
sentence of silent, tactile stewardship over another man’s sacrifice.
The map in my pocket was no longer just a ledger of wounds. It was a
maintenance schedule. And I had just accepted my first assignment.</p>
<p>The needle had felt the next thread. It was not sound. It was not
sight. It was the constant, whispering vibration of strain. And it was
not waiting. It had woven itself into me. I was no longer just following
the map.</p>
<p>I was becoming part of the territory.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-19-1"><strong>Chapter 19</strong></h2>
<p>The awareness was a new kind of gravity. It did not pull from a
single point, but from everywhere at once. The city was no longer a
collection of objects, but a lattice of tensions. I felt the hum of
high-tension wires strung between HDB blocks as a taut, metallic song
along my jaw. The deep, grumbling complaint of a piledriver in the new
Downtown Line extension was a fist slowly clenching in my gut. My walk
was no longer aimless. It was a navigation through a field of invisible
pressures, a man wading through a sea of silent vibrations.</p>
<p>I found myself on the pedestrian bridge over the Singapore River, the
water a slick, black muscle in the evening light. The tourist bars along
Boat Quay were beginning to thrum with a different frequency, a shallow,
rhythmic pulse of bass and forced laughter. I leaned on the railing, the
cool metal a sharp, clarifying line against my palms. Below, a tourist
barge puttered past, its electric motor a dentist’s-drill whine that set
my teeth on edge. I closed my eyes. Beneath the tourist veneer, I could
feel the old river’s memory—the groan of wooden <em>tongkangs</em>, the
slosh of night soil, the deeper, older silence of the mangroves that had
been paved into financial districts. The past was not a story. It was a
resonance trapped in strata, and I was developing a sensitivity to its
specific pitch.</p>
<p>The map in my pocket was a cold, flat square against my thigh. I did
not need to take it out. The location it implied was not a point on a
street grid, but a knot in the vibrational field. The old aquarium. The
hollow. The monk in his shimmering prison. That was a locus of profound,
artificial silence, a vacuum that pulled at the edges of my new
perception. But the needle in my mind—the one that had once twitched
toward sound—was now tracing a different thread. It quivered, not toward
silence, but toward a specific, escalating strain. A place where the
lattice was bending, close to snapping.</p>
<p>It led me east, away from the river’s curated history, into the
labyrinth of Geylang.</p>
<p>The rain had returned, not as a solid wall, but as a persistent, warm
mist that haloed the streetlights and turned the air into a broth of
exhaust and <em>teh tarik</em> and the damp, vegetal smell of produce
boxes stacked outside the late-night markets. The five-foot ways here
were cluttered with plastic stools, bicycles, the spill of light from
open-fronted eateries. The noise was a cacophony—the sizzle of woks, the
rapid-fire dialect of uncles playing chess, the tinny prayer song from a
Hindu shrine wedged between a motorcycle repair shop and a money
changer. It was a texture so thick I could almost chew it.</p>
<p>But underneath, the thread pulled. A dissonance. A vibration that was
not in harmony with the chaotic, living hum of the place. It was a dry,
splintering sound felt rather than heard, like the slow tear of cheap
canvas.</p>
<p>I turned into a side lane, narrower, darker. The colourful signage
faded. Here were the back ends of warehouses, the blank faces of storage
facilities, a few darkened, two-storey shophouses with ornate, grimy
façades hinting at a grander, forgotten past. The strain was centred on
one of these. Number 37. The windows were boarded with new, untreated
plywood, a raw yellow against the soot-stained plaster. A padlock, thick
and shockingly bright, hung on a rusted gate that barred the entrance to
the five-foot way.</p>
<p>I stood before it. The sensation was unmistakable. It was a psychic
tinnitus, a high, tight frequency that made the bones of my inner ears
ache. This was not a hollow. This was a splinter. A place where
something had happened—violently, abruptly—and the shock had never been
absorbed. It had been left to vibrate, to fray the edges of reality
around it. Thorne’s science would have called it a traumatic resonance.
The monk might have called it an un-whispered scream. I had no name for
it. I only knew it was a tear in the fabric, and the map—and whatever
had rewired my senses—had brought me here to witness it.</p>
<p>This was the maintenance. Not the silent vigil over a contained
wound, but the assessment of a new one.</p>
<p>A voice, dry as dust, came from the shadows to my left. “Looking for
someone?”</p>
<p>An old woman sat on a low stool in the recessed doorway of the
neighbouring shophouse. She was barely a silhouette, wrapped in a dark
<em>sarong kebaya</em>, a tiny red ember from a cigarette the only point
of life in her face.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “Just… looking.”</p>
<p>The ember bobbed. “Nothing to see. Empty for years.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t feel empty.”</p>
<p>The words were out before I could stop them. They hung in the damp
air. The ember glowed brighter as she took a long drag.</p>
<p>“Feel,” she repeated, the word devoid of curiosity. A statement. “You
one of those. From the temple? The government?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Good. They come. They take pictures. They write. They go.” She
exhaled a stream of smoke that was instantly absorbed by the mist. “It
doesn’t go.”</p>
<p>I took a step closer, out of the drizzle. The strain from Number 37
was a physical pressure against my right side. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“Fire,” she said, simple and final. “Long time. Not a big fire. A
small, hungry fire. Upstairs.” She gestured with her chin. “A family.
The man worked at the port. The woman sewed. Two children. A girl, a
boy.” She listed them like items on a manifest. “The fire ate the
oxygen. They slept. They did not wake up.”</p>
<p>A tragedy. A private, terrible grief. But Singapore was paved over
private grief. This was different.</p>
<p>“And then?” I prompted, my voice low.</p>
<p>The red ember traced a slow circle in the dark. “Then the noise.
After they cleared, after the boards went up. Not from inside. From… the
space. A sound like… bending bamboo. Like a ship’s rope pulled too
tight. Every night. For months.” She tapped her temple. “Drove the
<em>ang moh</em> accountant next door away. Gave the Indian tailor
migraines. Then, one day, it stopped. Just like that. But the quiet it
left… it is not a good quiet. It is a listening quiet.” She finally
turned her head, and I caught the faint gleam of a watchful eye. “You
feel the listening?”</p>
<p>I did. The splintering sensation was the sound of that silence under
immense tension. It was listening for an echo that never came.</p>
<p>“Why do you stay?” I asked.</p>
<p>The shrug was almost imperceptible. “I am old. My quiet is inside me.
Their quiet is outside. We have an understanding.” She flicked the
cigarette stub into a puddle where it died with a hiss. “You should go.
Understanding takes time. You don’t have time.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“You are standing like the building is shouting at you.” She shifted,
the rustle of her clothing like dry leaves. “It is not shouting. It is
holding its breath. When it decides to exhale, you do not want to be
here.”</p>
<p>A cold clarity washed over me. The monk’s hollow was a contained,
managed wound. This was an open, festering one. The map wasn’t just a
record; it was a triage system. And this site was critical. The monk’s
sacrifice held a crack closed. No one was sacrificing anything here. The
crack was widening on its own.</p>
<p>I reached out, not with my hand, but with that new, awful attention.
I pushed it toward the boarded-up doorway of Number 37. I felt the dry,
splintering vibration, the held breath. And then, beneath it, I felt the
four points of absence. Not hollows, but negative spaces, shaped like
people. A deeper cold, a vacuum that the tension wrapped around. They
were still there. Not ghosts. Echoes of a terminal silence, trapped in
the moment of its creation.</p>
<p>My stomach turned. This was not a haunting to be resolved. It was a
wound that had cauterised itself incorrectly. The tissue had grown back
twisted, binding the memory into the very bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>The old woman was right. I had to go. But not to leave. To understand
what was required. The monk had become a living damper, a human
silencer. What did this splinter need? A release valve? A burial?</p>
<p>As I turned, the old woman spoke once more, her voice now barely a
whisper. “The boy’s toy. A metal car. Red. It fell through the
floorboards, into the shop below. They never got it back.”</p>
<p>A detail. A tiny, anchoring fact in the metaphysical catastrophe. I
nodded, a gesture she probably couldn’t see, and walked back into the
mist-shrouded lane. The vibrational thread from Number 37 remained
attached to me, a taut line of discomfort anchored between my shoulder
blades. I was no longer just sensing the territory. I was collecting its
burdens.</p>
<p>I walked for hours, a sleepwalker through a city of invisible
strains. I felt the low-grade psychic scar of an old traffic accident
near a busy intersection, a persistent ripple of shock in the asphalt. I
felt the gentle, sorrowful resonance of a demolished kampung, now a car
park, its memory a faint, humid sigh under the concrete. The map was
alive in my mind, each of Thorne’s marks now glowing with a specific
qualitative signature. Some were dormant, quiet scars. Some, like Number
37, were active, weeping lesions.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking was over. I had not found enlightenment, or
peace, or even answers. I had been conscripted as a sensory organ for
the city’s pain. I was a living tuning fork, struck once by the hollow’s
silence and now forever vibrating to the hidden frequencies of
Singapore’s unresolved past.</p>
<p>Dawn was a grey smear in the sky when I finally stumbled back toward
Spottiswoode Park. The world was softening into monochrome, the night’s
textures blurring. My body was a shipwreck of exhaustion, but my mind
was horribly clear. I needed a plan. I needed to understand the rules of
this stewardship. The monk was one model. There had to be others.</p>
<p>As I approached the shophouse, I saw a figure sitting on the front
steps, under the ixora. Not Auntie Li. A man. He was hunched, elbows on
knees, staring at the wet ground. He felt my approach and looked up.</p>
<p>It was Ben, the historian from the archives. His face was pale, his
eyes wide with a fear that had eroded his usual academic composure. He
looked like a man who had seen a ghost, or finally understood a terrible
truth in a dusty document.</p>
<p>“You,” he breathed, standing up. He was clutching a manila folder to
his chest like a shield. “I’ve been waiting for hours. I didn’t know
where else to go.”</p>
<p>His normal frequency was gone. In its place was a jagged, erratic
pulse of panic. It clashed against my own overloaded senses.</p>
<p>“Ben. What is it?”</p>
<p>“You asked me about the aquarium. About the silence.” He swallowed,
his throat clicking. “I kept looking. Not at the aquarium. Around it.
The context.” He thrust the folder toward me. His hands were trembling.
“I found the architect. And then I found the project before the
aquarium. And the one before that.”</p>
<p>I took the folder. The paper inside felt charged, dangerous.</p>
<p>“He had a specialty,” Ben said, his voice dropping to a
conspiratorial whisper, though the street was empty. “Thorne. His firm.
They weren’t just building public works. They were being hired, quietly,
by the government, by private entities… for remediation.”</p>
<p>“Remediation of what?”</p>
<p>Ben’s eyes locked onto mine. “Of places. Places where things happened
that couldn’t be explained. That caused… disturbances. A factory in
Jurong where machinery would fail for no reason. A stretch of road in
Mandai with an impossible number of accidents. A school corridor where
children kept hearing whispers.” He pointed a shaking finger at the
folder. “It’s all in there. Proposals, invoices, vague descriptions. He
didn’t fix them. Not like an engineer. He… contained them. He designed
structures to dampen, to isolate, to <em>hold</em>.”</p>
<p>The monk’s words echoed in my skull. <em>My prison is also a filter.
A baffle box.</em> Thorne wasn’t just a scientist of acoustics. He was
an architect of silence. A builder of metaphysical containment
units.</p>
<p>“The aquarium was his masterpiece,” I said, the pieces slotting into
place with a cold, logical finality. “A perfect, resonant chamber. Not
to hold fish. To hold a scream.”</p>
<p>Ben nodded, a frantic, jerky motion. “But I followed the money. The
trail. The aquarium project was funded by a shell company. Untraceable,
almost. But I am a very good historian.” A strange, grim pride flickered
in his terror. “It led back. To a holding company. And that company… it
was a subsidiary. Of a family office.”</p>
<p>The mist around us seemed to grow colder. “Whose family?”</p>
<p>Ben’s mouth worked for a moment before the name came out. “The name
on the deed for the land the aquarium was built on. Before it was a
failed seafood restaurant. Before it was anything.” He took a step
closer, the smell of his sweat and fear sharp in the damp air. “It was
owned by a <em>baba</em> family. Very wealthy. Very private. They sold
it for a pittance in the late 80s. The family name was… Li.”</p>
<p>The world did not tilt. It simply focused, with a razor’s-edge
precision, on the single, obvious point I had been too blind to see.
Auntie Li. Her convenient shophouse. Her vague stories. Her absence when
things became… metaphysical. Her knowing exactly where to send me.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just a kindly landlady with a spare room. She was a
stakeholder. A custodian. Perhaps the latest in a line of them.</p>
<p>Ben saw the understanding dawn on my face. “You know something,” he
accused, his fear curdling into something like anger. “You’re involved.
I brought you the archive box, and then you vanished, and now… now I’m
seeing things. Hearing things in my flat. A sound like… like static in
the walls. It followed me home from the records hall.”</p>
<p>Of course it had. He had touched the thread. He had pulled on the
history, and the history had felt his attention. He was not like me. He
had no rewired senses, no monastic training. He was just a man who had
looked into the abyss of Singapore’s suppressed resonance, and the abyss
had glanced back.</p>
<p>“You need to leave Singapore, Ben,” I said, my voice flat, final.</p>
<p>“What? I can’t just—”</p>
<p>“You can. You must. Go on holiday. Visit family. Now. Today.” I
gripped his shoulder. The vibrational panic radiating from him was
nauseating. “Forget the folder. Forget Thorne. Forget the aquarium. It
is not a historical curiosity. It is a live mine. And you are standing
on it.”</p>
<p>He stared at me, his academic’s mind fighting against the visceral,
animal truth he now felt. The static in his walls was winning the
argument.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?” he whispered.</p>
<p>I looked past him, at the door to my shophouse. At the blue ceramic
frog, the stubborn ixora. The door behind which a seemingly benign old
woman held the keys to more than just a rental property.</p>
<p>“I,” I said, “am going to have a conversation with my landlady.”</p>
<p>I left him on the steps, a scared man clutching his dangerous
knowledge. I entered the shophouse. The familiar smells of lemon polish
and old wood greeted me. The space felt different now. Not a refuge, but
an outpost. The sitting room was empty. I walked through to the back, to
the small, shaded courtyard where Auntie Li tended her orchids.</p>
<p>She was there, not gardening. She was sitting perfectly still on a
stone bench, her hands folded in her lap. She was dressed not in her
usual housedress, but in a simple, elegant <em>cheongsam</em> of dark
blue silk. She looked like she was waiting for an important guest. Or a
reckoning.</p>
<p>She looked up as I entered. Her face was serene, but her eyes held no
surprise. Only a deep, weary acceptance.</p>
<p>“You have been to the quiet place,” she said. It wasn’t a
question.</p>
<p>“I have met its keeper,” I replied.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly. “And now you have seen another kind of wound. The
kind that is not kept.”</p>
<p>“Number thirty-seven, Geylang.”</p>
<p>A flicker of something—respect, perhaps—crossed her features. “You
are a fast study. That is good. And not good.” She patted the space on
the bench beside her. “Sit. You are vibrating like a plucked string. You
will make the orchids nervous.”</p>
<p>I sat. The stone was cool through my trousers. The gentle hum of the
refrigerator from inside the house was a distant, mundane comfort.</p>
<p>“The Li family,” I said. “You.”</p>
<p>“My husband’s family,” she corrected softly. “I married into the
duty. He has been gone ten years. So it passes.” She looked at her
hands, at the simple gold wedding band she always wore. “The scream in
the aquarium… it belonged to my husband’s great-uncle. A sensitive man.
A poet. He heard something he should not have heard, in a place that no
longer exists. It unravelled him. It lived in him, and when he died, it
did not die. It… spilled. Thorne was hired to bottle the spill.”</p>
<p>The matter-of-fact way she said it was more chilling than any
dramatic telling.</p>
<p>“And you? What is your role?”</p>
<p>“The family oversees the covenant. We ensure the keeper is… kept.
Provisions. Security. Discretion.” She met my gaze. “And we watch for
new threads. For people like you. The sensitive. The drawn. The ones who
feel the map before they see it.”</p>
<p>My rental. Her kindness. It was not chance. It was recruitment.</p>
<p>“You brought me here.”</p>
<p>“I provided the address,” she said. “You found the door. You turned
the key. You followed the thread. That is not on me. That is in you.”
She leaned forward, her voice dropping. “The monk’s way is one way. A
noble one. A life of pure containment. But it is not the only way. The
map Thorne left… it is not just a maintenance guide. It is a… a
curriculum. For a different kind of steward.”</p>
<p>“A fixer,” I said, the word bitter on my tongue.</p>
<p>“A resolver,” she countered. “The monk contains a single, massive
wound. The map points to a hundred smaller ones. Festering splinters,
like the one you felt in Geylang. They weaken the whole. His silence is
the dam. Your work would be to shore up the riverbanks, to prevent new
cracks from reaching it.”</p>
<p>The scale of it was staggering. A secret, silent maintenance crew for
the soul of a city that pretended to have no past, only future.</p>
<p>“And the boy’s red car?” I asked, testing her.</p>
<p>She did not blink. “An anchor. A focal object. To resolve a splinter,
you must often find the physical anchor of the trauma and… reposition
it. Lay it to rest with the proper rites. It gives the silent echo a
point of release. The car is still in the building. In the rubble. It
holds a piece of the boy’s silence.”</p>
<p>She knew. She knew about every mark on the map. She was the silent
dispatcher.</p>
<p>“Why me?” The question was a plea.</p>
<p>“Because you are unmoored,” she said, not unkindly. “You have no life
here to disrupt. No family to endanger. You have the sensitivity. And
you have the choice that the monk did not have. You can say no. You can
leave. You can get on a plane and the hum in your bones will fade, in
time, to a bad memory.” She paused, letting the offer hang in the humid
air. “Or you can stay. You can learn. You can use this curse of
perception to mend, instead of just to suffer.”</p>
<p>The hook was not in the mystery anymore. It was in the terrible,
practical offer of purpose. A use for the hollow ringing. A meaning for
the map.</p>
<p>“What would be my first task?” I heard myself ask.</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s lips curved into a smile that held no joy, only solemn
resolve. She reached into a fold of her <em>cheongsam</em> and produced
a small, old key, tarnished with age.</p>
<p>“The red car,” she said. “You located the splinter. You identified
the anchor. The next step is retrieval. Before the silence there decides
to exhale.”</p>
<p>She placed the cold, heavy key in my palm. It was for the padlock on
the gate at Number 37.</p>
<p>The maintenance schedule was no longer theoretical. My first
assignment was not observation. It was excavation. I was to go into that
listening quiet, find a dead boy’s toy, and somehow, through an act I
did not yet understand, use it to suture a tear in the world.</p>
<p>I closed my fingers around the key. It felt less like a tool and more
like the first link in a new chain.</p>
<p>The needle had felt the thread. It had pulled me across the world,
through silence and into sound, and now into the vibrating space
between. I had thought I was becoming part of the territory.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>I was being given my first parcel of land to tend.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-20-1"><strong>Chapter 20</strong></h2>
<p>The key to the padlock at Number 37 was a weight in my pocket. It was
not the key’s own mass, which was slight, but the density of the silence
it was meant to unlock. I carried it from Auntie Li’s shophouse back to
my own, the afternoon sun a hammer on the pavement, turning yesterday’s
rain into a thick, visible steam that rose from the concrete. The city
was breathing out. The hollow ringing in my bones had changed its tune.
It was no longer a question. It was a low, preparatory hum, the sound a
plucked string makes just before it is tuned to its proper note.</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs to my room. The map was on the desk, a sprawl of
suffering I had only begun to catalogue. The red pin at the construction
site was a wound. My task was to clean it. The monk, Tharman, had
located the splinter—the boy’s toy car, a nexus of unfinished love and
sudden terror. My sensitivity had confirmed it, had felt the silent,
screaming shape of it. Now I was to retrieve it. Not for evidence. Not
for closure. For an act of spiritual hygiene.</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s instructions had been precise, and spare. “Go at the
lull. Three PM. The site is quiet then. The machines are sleeping. The
men are at tea. You will have an hour of the day’s deepest breath. Find
the car. Do not touch it with your bare skin. Use the cloth.” She had
given me a square of undyed linen, coarse and plain. “Place it in the
box.” The box was a simple thing of <em>meranti</em> wood, unvarnished,
with a clasp but no lock. “Then you bring it here. We will prepare it
for the rite.”</p>
<p>“And the rite?” I had asked.</p>
<p>“One thing at a time,” she had said. “First, you must meet the
silence on its own ground. You must take something from it. That is a
different kind of listening.”</p>
<p>Back in my room, I laid out the tools. The cloth. The box. A small
torch. My own fear, a cold, slick stone in my gut. This was not passive
perception anymore. This was intervention. I was a needle being asked
not just to feel the tear in the fabric, but to begin the stitch. The
responsibility was a physical pressure, a band tightening around my
temples.</p>
<p>At half-past two, the heat was a solid presence. I walked. The city’s
sound was a blanket—the distant growl of traffic, the arrhythmic
percussion of construction from other sites, the murmur of a thousand
air-conditioning units exhaling damp heat. I was a moving part through a
still life. The map in my mind was no longer abstract. The red pin was a
destination. I was walking toward a specific grief.</p>
<p>The fence at Number 37 appeared, a corrugated tin barrier stained
with rust and street dust. The padlock hung from the chain-link gate, a
dull black slug. The site beyond was a crater of arrested ambition. The
excavation pit was a deep, rectangular wound, shored up with metal
braces. At its bottom, a pool of rainwater reflected the hard blue sky,
a misplaced piece of heaven in the mud. The silent crane stood sentinel,
its hook a frozen question mark.</p>
<p>This was the lull. No generator hum. No shouted Hokkien or Bengali.
Just the liquid coo of a spotted dove from a nearby <em>angsana</em>
tree, and the buzz of flies over a discarded lunch packet.</p>
<p>The key turned in the padlock with a gritty, metallic shriek that
seemed to tear the quiet. I winced at the volume of it. I slipped
through the gate, closed it behind me, and the world shrank to the
dimensions of the pit.</p>
<p>The air in the site was different. Thicker. It held the smells of
damp clay, rust, and diesel, but beneath that was the sterile, metallic
scent of concentrated quiet. The hum in my bones sharpened, resolving
into a single, thin note, high and steady, like the sound a wineglass
makes when a finger traces its rim. It was coming from the north-east
corner of the pit, where the rubble of the demolished annexe had been
piled before work stopped.</p>
<p>Auntie Li’s directions had been clear. <em>Third level of the
terrace, western retaining wall, behind the fallen lintel</em>. I picked
my way down the temporary wooden stairs fixed to the pit’s side. The
wood groaned under my weight. Each step was a concession to gravity, a
descent into the bowl of silence.</p>
<p>The mud at the bottom was treacherous, sucking at my shoes. I moved
toward the rubble pile. The fallen lintel was a long, grey finger of
reinforced concrete, half-buried in broken brick and tile. The boy’s
silence was here. It was not a memory. It was a climate. The air was
colder. The flies avoided this spot.</p>
<p>I switched on the torch. The beam cut through the shadow under the
lintel, revealing a cavity. There, nestled in a cradle of dust and
crumbled mortar, was the car.</p>
<p>It was a toy sedan, once bright red, now faded to a rusty pink. One
of its plastic wheels was missing. The windshield was a web of cracks.
It was not buried, not hidden. It was placed, with a terrible,
deliberate care, in a small, clean space of its own. A shrine of
one.</p>
<p>The high note in my bones became a vibration in my teeth. This was
the anchor. This was the object that held the boy’s final,
uncomprehending moment, the love for his father that had nowhere to go,
the terror that had been swallowed by concrete. It was a seed of pure,
unresolved emotion. A splinter in the skin of the world.</p>
<p>I did not want to touch it. My every instinct screamed to leave it,
to back away, to let the earth take it when the bulldozers finally
returned. But the hum was a command. The key in my pocket was a
promise.</p>
<p>I unfolded the square of linen. The coarse fabric felt correct,
impersonal. I knelt in the mud, the damp immediately soaking through the
knees of my trousers. The cold was intense. My breath fogged in the beam
of the torch.</p>
<p>I reached out, the cloth draped over my hand like a shroud. My
fingers closed around the car.</p>
<p>The silence exploded.</p>
<p>It was not a sound. It was the vacuum left when all sound is ripped
away. It was a roar of absence. The world did not go dark—it went
<em>flat</em>, stripped of dimension, like a photograph. The grey of the
concrete, the brown of the mud, the pink of the toy, all bled into a
single, muted tone.</p>
<p>And then the feeling came. It was not a memory played in my head. It
was a direct transfusion.</p>
<p>A child’s fierce, hot love, a sun burning in the chest. The smell of
his father’s shirt—starch and cigarettes and safety. The thrilling,
secret joy of being somewhere forbidden, of being a co-conspirator in a
game of hide-and-seek from the foreman. The rough texture of the
unfinished concrete under small knees.</p>
<p>Then, the shift. A deep, groaning shiver through the floor. Not a
sound, but a vibration in the marrow. The sun of love snuffed out by a
flood of animal fear, so acute it was a taste of copper in the mouth.
The sight of the ceiling cracking, a black spiderweb against the grey. A
desperate, wordless scramble. The toy car, clutched too tight, falling
from a hand that was suddenly empty. The world tilting, dissolving into
a storm of grey dust and crushing noise.</p>
<p>And then… the quiet. A quiet so vast, so complete, it had a texture
like wool packed in the ears. A quiet that lasted for hours that felt
like forever. A quiet where the only thing left was the fading imprint
of a red car against the mind’s eye, and a question that had no words:
<em>Abah?</em></p>
<p>It was not a ghost. It was an echo trapped in a jar. And I had just
lifted the lid.</p>
<p>I gasped, wrenching my perception back into my own skull. I was on my
knees in the mud, trembling violently. The linen-wrapped car was in my
hand. It felt inert now, just old plastic and metal. But I had felt its
contents. I had drunk the dregs of that silent, final hour.</p>
<p>With fumbling hands, I placed the car in the wooden box. The moment
the lid closed, the high note in my bones ceased. The ordinary sounds of
the city filtered back in—the dove, a distant siren, the sigh of the
wind in the crane’s cables. The silence of the pit remained, but it was
no longer charged. It was just quiet.</p>
<p>I stood up, my legs weak. The box under my arm was light, but I
carried the weight of the boy’s last afternoon. It was inside me now. I
had not just retrieved an object. I had taken custody of a story.</p>
<p>The climb out of the pit was harder. The box required one hand. The
wooden stairs seemed steeper. When I reached the top and turned to look
back, the cavity under the lintel was just a shadow. The anchor was
gone. The silence was already different—lighter, emptier, waiting to be
filled with something else.</p>
<p>I locked the padlock behind me. The metallic clank was final. I
walked back through the steaming streets, the box held close. People
passed me, talking on phones, carrying shopping, living lives that were
not interrupted by echoes. I felt like a courier for an invisible world,
carrying a secret so small and so devastating it could fit in a wooden
box.</p>
<p>Auntie Li was waiting in the back room of the shophouse. The air was
cool, scented with sandalwood and the faint, dry smell of herbs. She had
cleared the low table. On it was a shallow brass bowl, a small vial of
clear oil, a bundle of dried sage, and a new, blank sheet of rice
paper.</p>
<p>She saw the box in my hands and her eyes, old and dark as tea, read
everything in my posture, in the set of my mouth.</p>
<p>“You met it,” she said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“I felt it,” I replied, my voice rough. “His… ending.”</p>
<p>She nodded, gesturing for me to place the box on the table. “To
retrieve an anchor is to share its burden for a little while. It is the
cost. Now, we transform the burden. We change its address.”</p>
<p>She opened the box. With a reverence that had nothing to do with
affection and everything to do with precision, she lifted the
linen-wrapped car and placed it in the brass bowl. She did not unwrap
it. She took the vial of oil and let three drops fall onto the linen.
The scent of camphor and something else, sharp and clean like crushed
pine needles, filled the space.</p>
<p>“The car is the anchor,” she said, her voice low and rhythmic. “It
holds the shape of the silence. The boy’s <em>shen</em>—his spirit, his
consciousness—is long gone. What remains is the <em>po</em>, the earthly
soul, the echo of bodily feeling and unresolved emotion. Stuck. Like a
fingerprint on glass.”</p>
<p>She lit the bundle of sage with a wooden match. The smoke rose, not
in a plume, but in a slow, coiling ribbon. She passed the bowl through
the smoke, once, twice, three times.</p>
<p>“We are not erasing the fingerprint,” she continued. “We are
transferring it. From a object of trauma, to a vessel of release.” She
placed the smoking sage in a ceramic holder and took up the blank rice
paper. “You located it. You retrieved it. Now, you will map it.”</p>
<p>She handed me a fine-tipped ink brush and a small stone inkwell.
“Close your eyes. Hold the shape of the silence you felt. Then, let your
hand draw the shape of it on the paper. Not a picture of the car. Not a
word. The shape of the echo itself.”</p>
<p>It was an impossible instruction. Yet, after what I had just
experienced, it felt like the only logical next step. I closed my eyes.
The memory of the silence was there, immediate and visceral. It was not
a image. It was a form—a sharp, jagged compression followed by a long,
hollow, cold stretch. A spike, then a flat line.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, dipped the brush, and let my hand move. I drew a
single, violent, downward stroke, dark and thick. Then, from its tip, I
drew a long, thin, horizontal line that trailed off the edge of the
paper. It was stark. It was ugly. It was exactly what I had felt.</p>
<p>Auntie Li studied it. “Yes,” she whispered. “The fracture and the
silence.” She took the paper, held it over the brass bowl, and touched
the corner to the still-smoldering sage. It caught fire.</p>
<p>She did not drop it. She held it as it burned, her fingers steady,
letting the ash fall directly onto the linen-wrapped car in the bowl.
The black flakes settled like a second shroud.</p>
<p>“The map is not always a place,” she said, watching the last corner
of paper curl and blacken. “Sometimes it is a state. You have mapped the
state. Now the anchor is no longer bound to the object. It is bound to
the map. And the map,” she said, blowing gently on the ashes, “can be
moved.”</p>
<p>She carefully folded the linen over the ashes and the car, making a
neat package, and placed it back in the wooden box. “Tomorrow, before
dawn, we will take this to the sea at East Coast. We will give the
silence back to the water, to be dissolved and carried away. The rite of
release.”</p>
<p>She closed the box. The room felt different. The air was clearer. The
oppressive weight I had carried from the construction site was still
present, but it was no longer a chaos inside me. It was contained, in
the box, mapped and ready for disposal. The process was practical,
almost clinical. It was spiritual seeking rendered as a craft.</p>
<p>“You have done the first full cycle,” Auntie Li said, looking at me.
“Location. Retrieval. Mapping. Soon, release. This is the work. This is
how you tend the land.”</p>
<p>I thought of the other pins on my map. The sobbing in the lift shaft.
The cold spot in the hospital corridor. The weight on the bed in the old
hotel. Each one was a splinter. Each one required this same meticulous,
painful extraction. The scale of it was daunting. I was one person with
a box of linen and a brush.</p>
<p>“It will take lifetimes,” I said, the fatigue hitting me all at
once.</p>
<p>“It does,” she agreed. “But you are not doing it for all the silences
everywhere. You are doing it for the one in front of you. You are a
needle, mending one stitch at a time. The territory is vast. Your parcel
is small. That is the only way it can be borne.”</p>
<p>She handed me the box. “Keep it with you tonight. Let it settle. The
echo is now between addresses. It is safest with the one who mapped
it.”</p>
<p>I took the box. It felt different. Not lighter, but integrated. It
was a task in progress, not a raw wound.</p>
<p>I walked back to my room in the violet dusk. The city’s lights were
coming on, turning the glass towers into grids of gold. The ordinary
world was asserting itself with its noise and its light. But I carried a
small, quiet darkness under my arm, a contained silence that was now my
responsibility to see through to its end.</p>
<p>That night, I placed the wooden box on my desk beside the larger map.
I slept, but my dreams were not my own. I dreamed of slow, dark water,
and of something small and heavy sinking down through the greenish
light, trailing a cloud of black ash like ink.</p>
<p>I woke just before dawn to the sound of my phone vibrating on the
wooden floor. A message, from an unknown number. No text. Just a single
image file.</p>
<p>I opened it.</p>
<p>It was a photograph, taken in low light. It showed a section of a
concrete drainage culvert, a <em>longkang</em>, choked with muddy water
and litter. And there, half-submerged in the muck, was a child’s sandal.
Pink, with a faded plastic flower on the strap.</p>
<p>Beneath the image, a location was tagged. A street name in Toa Payoh.
A place not yet marked on my map.</p>
<p>The humming in my bones, which had quieted to a bare murmur after the
mapping, returned. A new frequency. A higher, more frantic pitch. It was
not an echo from the past.</p>
<p>The timestamp on the image was from three hours ago.</p>
<p>This was not a parcel of land to tend.</p>
<p>This was a dispatch.</p>
<p>The needle had not finished its first stitch before it was being
pulled toward a new tear. The territory was not static. It was alive,
and it was calling. Not with the slow, cold silence of decades, but with
the fresh, wet silence of a single, recent night.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-21-1"><strong>Chapter 21</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Toa Payoh was a different animal. It was not the silver
wall of Spottiswoode Park. It was a greasy drizzle that clung to the
sodium-orange streetlights and made the asphalt shine like the skin of a
wet fish. The air here smelled of damp concrete, of <em>bak kut teh</em>
from a late-night stall, and underneath it all, the faint, metallic tang
of water that has run through too many pipes, over too much stone. I
stood at the mouth of the tagged street, the image on my phone a cold
square of light in my hand. The pink sandal, the plastic flower. The
timestamp, ticking forward in my head. Three hours was nothing. Three
hours was a lifetime.</p>
<p>The humming was a live wire under my skin. It was not the deep,
resonant frequency of the old, mapped silence. This was a sharp,
insistent buzz, a Morse code of dread. It did not pull from the soles of
my feet. It pulled from behind my sternum, a hook set deep in the bone.
This was not an echo. It was a signal. And it was active.</p>
<p>I had left the shophouse with the wooden box in my backpack, the map
folded carefully inside my jacket. The ordinary world of the violet dusk
was gone, peeled back to reveal this other layer, this wet, urgent
membrane. The city at this hour was a creature of shifts and shadows.
Taxis hissed past, their tyres whispering on the wet road. A lone man
pushed a cart of cardboard, the wheels squeaking a protest with every
revolution. I was a stitch pulled loose, moving against the grain of the
night.</p>
<p>The tagged location led me not to a house or a shop, but to a service
road behind a row of HDB blocks. The blocks loomed in the darkness, a
chessboard of lit and unlit windows. Below them, at ground level, was
the drainage network. The <em>longkang</em>. A concrete channel, perhaps
four feet wide, cutting a straight, grim line between the towering
residences and a darkened playground. The channel was full. The rain had
seen to that. The water moved with a slow, brown purpose, carrying with
it the detritus of the day: a plastic bottle, a sodden newspaper, a
single flip-flop. It moved towards a larger culvert, a dark mouth
half-submerged beneath the road.</p>
<p>I knelt on the wet grass verge, the damp immediately soaking through
the knee of my trousers. I took out my phone, compared the image to the
reality. The angle was right. The photograph had been taken from here,
looking down into the channel where it curved. The sandal was gone.
Washed away, or removed. But the place held the signal. The air was
thick with it. It was the silence after a scream has been cut short. A
positive, aggressive silence.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, not to listen, but to feel. The mapping had taught
me that. The land did not speak in words. It spoke in pressure, in
temperature, in the subtle directional tug of a memory that had weight.
This memory had no age. It was fresh. It was bleeding.</p>
<p>The pull came from downstream. Towards the culvert.</p>
<p>I stood, my joints stiff. The backpack with its box of contained
silence felt alien on my shoulders, a relic from a different kind of
war. This was not a war of attrition. This was a search party. I
followed the channel’s edge, my shoes slipping on the wet grass. The hum
in my chest tightened, a string tuned to a breaking point.</p>
<p>The mouth of the culvert was a circle of pure blackness, a pupil in
the eye of the city. Water poured into it with a low, gulping sound. A
rusted iron grate, meant to catch larger debris, was partially torn
away, bent backwards like a ripped fingernail. The signal pulsed from
that darkness. It was a beacon in reverse, drawing the cold towards
it.</p>
<p>I could not go in there. Not physically. The water was deep, the
current stronger than it looked. And the darkness was a solid thing. But
the signal did not originate from within the pipe. It pooled there,
collected by the flow, but it was spilling from somewhere else.
Somewhere upstream. Somewhere dry.</p>
<p>I tracked backwards, my senses straining against the mundane noise of
the night—a distant siren, the thump of bass from a passing car. The
humming began to differentiate. It was not a single note. Underneath the
sharp panic was a thread of something else. A warmer frequency.
Confusion. A disorientation that was not born of fear, but of simple,
profound loss.</p>
<p>It led me away from the main channel, up a shallow, weed-choked
embankment, to a narrow footpath that ran behind a row of locked storage
units. The path was lit by a single, flickering lamp. And there, tucked
against the corrugated metal door of a unit, was a small, forlorn
shape.</p>
<p>It was a school bag. A child’s backpack, bright purple with a cartoon
character I didn’t recognise. It was unzipped, gaping open. A few
textbooks and a pencil case had spilled out onto the wet ground, the
pages already bloated and ruined. Next to it, lying separate, was the
other pink sandal.</p>
<p>I did not touch them. I stood over them, and the two frequencies of
the hum resolved into a terrible chord. The sharp panic—that was the
place, the <em>longkang</em>, the conduit. The warmer confusion—that was
here. This was the point of severance. The bag had been dropped. The
sandals had come off. The signal was not of a thing that had been
placed, but of a connection that had been broken. Violently, and
recently.</p>
<p>This was not a parcel of land. This was a thread. A thread that had
been snapped, and the two raw ends were vibrating, sending out a
distress call across a frequency only the lost, and the foolish, could
hear.</p>
<p>I heard a scuffling sound from the deeper shadows between two storage
units. A low, ragged breath.</p>
<p>I went still. The ordinary fear, the animal fear of a dark alley, was
a cold wash over my scalp. But underneath it, the hum did not change. It
recognised the sound.</p>
<p>“Hello?” I said, my voice too loud in the contained space.</p>
<p>The scuffling stopped. The breathing hitched.</p>
<p>I took a slow step forward. “I’m not going to hurt you. I… I found
the bag.”</p>
<p>A shape detached itself from the blackness. Small, hunched. It was a
boy. He looked to be eight, maybe nine. He was soaked to the skin, his
hair plastered to his forehead. He wore only one sock. His eyes were
wide, but they were not focused on me. They were focused on a point
somewhere past my shoulder, at nothing. In his arms, he clutched a
sodden, filthy bundle of brown and white fur. A puppy. It was shivering,
a continuous, pathetic tremor.</p>
<p>“He fell,” the boy whispered. His voice was scraped raw. “In the
water. I got him out. But I can’t find my sister. She ran. She was
scared.”</p>
<p>The hum in my chest split again. The boy and his puppy were one
source—the warm, confused frequency. The sister was the other—the sharp,
panicked signal that led to the <em>longkang</em>. The thread was
between them. And it was stretching thin.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” I asked, kneeling slowly, bringing myself to his
level.</p>
<p>“Kai,” he said. He didn’t look at me.</p>
<p>“Kai. My name is… it doesn’t matter. Your sister. Which way did she
run?”</p>
<p>He lifted a trembling hand and pointed back towards the service road,
towards the channel. “She was crying. She slipped. Then she was gone.”
He said it flatly, as if describing something from a television show.
The shock had sanded the edges off his terror.</p>
<p>Gone. Not into the water. The signal did not come from the water
itself. It came from the <em>conduit</em>. The culvert was a throat. It
led somewhere.</p>
<p>The puppy whined, a thin, reedy sound. Kai clutched it tighter. “My
Amah will be angry. We weren’t supposed to be out. We were looking for
him.” He nuzzled the wet fur. “He got lost.”</p>
<p>Two lost things finding a third, and creating a fourth. The
arithmetic of disaster.</p>
<p>I could not leave him. The practical part of my mind, the London
part, screamed to call the police, to hand this over to the competent,
the official. But the hum knew better. The police would come with lights
and noise and questions. They would trample the signal. They would not
understand that the sister was not just a girl in a drain; she was a
point of active resonance in a territory that was awake and hungry. By
the time they mapped their search grids, the thread would have
dissolved. She would become a parcel of land, to be tended in decades to
come.</p>
<p>I took out my phone. I had no numbers for emergencies here. Only one
contact felt remotely appropriate. I scrolled and pressed call on Meng’s
number. He answered on the second ring, his voice alert, devoid of
sleep.</p>
<p>“You have a reading,” he said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“A fresh one. A child. In the Toa Payoh drains. Her brother is with
me. He’s in shock. I need you to come. Quietly.”</p>
<p>He was silent for a beat. I heard the rustle of fabric, the jingle of
keys. “Location. Now.”</p>
<p>I sent him the pin. “There’s a puppy,” I added, uselessly.</p>
<p>“Keep the boy warm. Do not let him follow you. I am ten minutes
away.” The line went dead.</p>
<p>I turned to Kai. “A friend is coming. A good friend. He will take
care of you and…” I looked at the puppy. “What’s his name?”</p>
<p>“Xiao Bai,” Kai murmured.</p>
<p>“He will take care of you and Xiao Bai. He will bring you home.”</p>
<p>Kai’s eyes finally flickered to mine. The confusion in them was a
physical pain. “But Mei… I have to find Mei.”</p>
<p>“I will look,” I said. The words were stones in my mouth. “I am good
at looking in dark places.”</p>
<p>It was the wrong thing to say. His face crumpled. “It’s very
dark.”</p>
<p>Meng arrived in eight minutes. He did not come in a car. He came on a
small, silent electric scooter, gliding to a halt on the footpath. He
was dressed in dark, practical clothing. He carried a small duffel bag.
He took in the scene—the boy, the puppy, the spilled school bag, my own
haunted face—with a single, sweeping glance. He did not ask for details.
He went straight to Kai, kneeling, his voice a low, steady murmur in
Mandarin. He produced a foil blanket from his bag and wrapped it around
the boy’s shoulders. He examined the puppy with gentle, efficient
hands.</p>
<p>“Mild hypothermia, for both,” he said to me, his tone clinical. “No
major injury. The shock is the greater concern.” He looked up at me, his
eyes reflecting the flickering lamp. “You are following the thread.”</p>
<p>“It’s pulling towards the culvert. But not from inside it. From
beyond it. It’s… a path.”</p>
<p>He nodded. He placed a hand on Kai’s head. “Stay with me, little
brother. Your friend is going to find a way to bring Mei back to the
path. You must hold this end for her. Can you do that? Hold the end of
the string?”</p>
<p>Kai, mesmerised by Meng’s calm authority, nodded weakly.</p>
<p>Meng looked back at me. He reached into his duffel and pulled out a
heavy-duty flashlight, a compact first-aid kit, and a small, zippered
pouch. He handed them to me. “The drainage system here is a map from the
1970s. It connects to the old <em>longkang</em> network, then to the
monsoon canal. It is a small world underneath. But it is easy to become
a ghost in it. Do not lose the hum. If the thread snaps while you are in
there, you will be lost with her.” He paused. “The box. Is it
quiet?”</p>
<p>I shrugged off my backpack, felt the solid weight of the wooden box.
The old, mapped silence within was dormant, a sleeping beast. It did not
react to this new, frantic signal. “It’s quiet.”</p>
<p>“Good. Two frequencies will confuse you. Follow the new one. The
fresh one. It is brighter. It will burn out faster.” He zipped his bag.
“Go. I have this.”</p>
<p>There was no blessing, no good luck. There was only an allocation of
tasks. I turned from the light, from the boy and the man and the
shivering puppy, and walked back towards the swallowing dark of the
culvert.</p>
<p>The hum was a compass needle now, spinning in my chest and then
locking, pointing straight into the black mouth. I switched on the
flashlight. The beam cut through the drizzle, illuminating the rushing
brown water as it vanished into the pipe. The grate was the only way. I
tested it with my hand. The torn section was sharp, but it offered a gap
just wide enough to squeeze through if I went into the water.</p>
<p>There was no way to do it dry. I took a breath, the smells of wet and
rust and decay filling my nostrils. I slung the backpack high on my
shoulders, clutched the flashlight, and stepped off the edge into the
channel.</p>
<p>The water was shockingly cold, a grip around my thighs that stole my
breath. The current tugged insistently at my legs. I waded the few feet
to the broken grate, turned sideways, and pushed myself through the
jagged opening. My shirt caught and ripped. A sharp pain scored my ribs.
Then I was through, inside the culvert.</p>
<p>The world changed. The sound of the city vanished, replaced by the
hollow, echoing roar of water flowing in a tube. The air was cold and
still and stank of stagnation. My flashlight beam danced over curved
concrete walls slick with algae, over the arching ceiling where roots
had pushed through, dangling like thin, white nerves. The water here was
waist-deep, moving with a stronger, smoother force. The hum was not
ahead of me. It was <em>around</em> me. The signal was not a point; it
was a smear. She had been here, her panic rubbing off on the walls,
soaking into the water.</p>
<p>I began to wade upstream, against the current. It was hard, slogging
work. The concrete underfoot was slippery. Every ten yards, a shaft of
faint, grey light pierced the darkness from a drain cover above,
checkering the water with fleeting, ghostly patterns. I passed
intersections where smaller pipes vomited their streams into the main
flow. The hum would falter at these junctions, then strengthen, pulling
me always to the left, taking the larger, older branch.</p>
<p>I lost track of time. There was only the cold, the resistance, the
roar, and the humming wire in my core. I was a stitch being drawn
through the city’s underside. I thought of the map in my jacket, dry for
now, a representation of the world above. It was useless here. This was
the negative space, the territory between addresses, given physical
form.</p>
<p>The pipe began to slope upwards. The water grew shallower, rushing
around my knees. The air grew slightly warmer, carrying a new smell—damp
earth, rotting vegetation. The concrete gave way to older, rougher
brick, then to stone. I was entering an older layer. The hum grew
clearer, sharper. The panic was crystallising into something else:
exhaustion, a fading pulse.</p>
<p>The tunnel opened abruptly into a wider space. My flashlight beam
failed to find a ceiling. I was in a cavern, a forgotten underground
chamber where several streams converged. The water pooled here, black
and seemingly still, before draining away through another, lower pipe.
The chamber was built of massive, mossy stones. It was not a modern
construction. It felt ancient, a secret cistern.</p>
<p>And there, on a narrow, dry ledge of stone along one wall, was a
small, huddled form.</p>
<p>Mei.</p>
<p>She was curled into a ball, her arms wrapped around her knees. She
was soaked, her clothes plastered to her tiny frame. She was not
moving.</p>
<p>The hum in my chest did not crescendo. It changed. The sharp panic
was gone. What remained was a faint, fading ember of self. A tiny, quiet
hum of <em>here I am</em>.</p>
<p>“Mei,” I said, softly. The chamber swallowed my voice.</p>
<p>She did not stir.</p>
<p>I waded through the stagnant pool to the ledge. The water was
chest-deep here, unnervingly warm in patches, cold in others. I hauled
myself onto the stone. It was slick with moss. I crawled to her.</p>
<p>“Mei. Your brother Kai is safe. Xiao Bai is safe.”</p>
<p>A tremor went through her. Slowly, very slowly, she uncurled. Her
face was pale, streaked with dirt and tears. She looked at me, but her
eyes were like her brother’s had been—seeing something else, something
in the space just behind the world.</p>
<p>“The lady,” she whispered, her voice a dry leaf rustle. “The lady in
the water told me to wait here.”</p>
<p>A cold that had nothing to do with the damp seized my spine. “What
lady?”</p>
<p>Mei’s gaze drifted past me, to the black pool. “She had long hair.
All around her like seaweed. She was very cold. She said to wait. She
said someone would come. A map-man.” She blinked, slowly. “Are you the
map-man?”</p>
<p>The hum in me stuttered. I followed her gaze to the water. My
flashlight beam played over the surface. It was opaque, a sheet of black
glass. But the hum… I focused. Underneath Mei’s fading signal, so deep I
had almost mistaken it for the stone itself, was another frequency.
Vast. Slow. Cold as the deep earth. It was the silence of the box in my
backpack, but older, wetter, and not contained. It was the silence of
the aquifer, of the bedrock. It was the lady in the water.</p>
<p>This territory was not just alive. It was inhabited.</p>
<p>“I’m a friend,” I managed to say, my throat tight. “I’m here to bring
you back to the path. Kai is holding the string for you.”</p>
<p>The word ‘string’ seemed to register. She nodded, a tiny, mechanical
motion. “I’m cold.”</p>
<p>I opened the first-aid kit Meng had given me. There was another foil
blanket. I wrapped it around her. She was light, a bundle of bird bones.
“I need to carry you, Mei. We have to go back through the water.”</p>
<p>She didn’t protest. She let me lift her, settling her on my hip. She
clung to my neck, her head resting on my shoulder. Her small hum
vibrated against my chest, a counter-rhythm to my own.</p>
<p>I slid back into the pool, holding her high. Turning, I cast the
flashlight beam one last time around the chamber. On the far wall, where
the stone met the water, I saw it. Not a carving. A stain. A dark,
mineral deposit that had formed over decades, perhaps centuries, into a
shape. It was vague, flowing. It could have been a trick of the light
and the moss. It could have been a woman with hair streaming out around
her.</p>
<p>The deep, cold hum from the water did not rise. It did not threaten.
It simply was. A presence. A keeper of this underground node. It had not
harmed the girl. It had told her to wait.</p>
<p><em>Someone would come. A map-man.</em></p>
<p>The territory was not just calling. It was expecting.</p>
<p>The journey back was a blur of strain and terror. Carrying Mei,
fighting the current, the flashlight clenched in my teeth. The hum was
our guide, but it was weakening in her, guttering like a candle in a
draft. My own strength was leaching away into the cold water. Twice I
slipped, going under, swallowing a mouthful of foulness, holding Mei
above the surface with a desperation that burned in my muscles.</p>
<p>When I finally saw the faint grey light of the drain cover near the
broken grate, it was like a vision of heaven. I pushed through the
opening, back into the channel behind the HDB blocks, and collapsed onto
the grass verge, Mei still clutched in my arms.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped. The sky was the colour of charcoal, the
pre-dawn bleed. The world was quiet.</p>
<p>Meng was there. He had Kai wrapped in a second blanket, sitting on
his scooter’s seat. Xiao Bai was tucked inside Kai’s jacket, only a
small, sleepy head visible. Meng’s eyes met mine. He saw the state of
us, saw the look on my face. He said nothing. He simply took Mei from my
arms, checking her pulse, her breathing, wrapping her more securely. She
murmured, “Kai?”</p>
<p>Her brother scrambled over, his face a mask of tear-streaked relief.
He didn’t speak. He just put his hand on her blanket-covered foot.</p>
<p>Meng helped me up. My legs were numb. He handed me a thermos. Sweet,
hot tea. It burned all the way down, anchoring me back into my body.</p>
<p>“The authorities are not involved,” Meng said quietly, as he settled
Mei on the scooter with Kai, making a nest of blankets around them. “I
will take them home. A story of a lost puppy and a fall in the park. It
will be believed. The mother is a nurse on the night shift. She will be
home soon.” He looked at me. “You saw something else.”</p>
<p>“The territory…” I began, my teeth chattering. “It’s not empty.”</p>
<p>He held my gaze for a long moment, then nodded, as if I had confirmed
something he long suspected. “The map is not just of places. It is of
presences. You have met one.”</p>
<p>“It knew I would come.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said, his voice almost gentle. “You are the needle.
The needle is drawn to the tears. The weaver of the territory knows its
own tools.” He started the scooter, a near-silient whirr. “Go home.
Clean the cut on your ribs. The boy’s sandals, the bag… I will handle
it. You have done the work. The thread is re-knit.”</p>
<p>He guided the scooter onto the path, the two small blanket-wrapped
figures leaning against him. They disappeared around a corner, back into
the waking world.</p>
<p>I stood alone on the grass, dripping, shivering. The hum was gone.
Both of them. Mei’s small signal had faded as she reconnected with her
brother. The deep, cold hum of the chamber was out of range, back in its
stone and water.</p>
<p>But the silence it left behind was not empty. It was pregnant.
<em>You are the needle.</em></p>
<p>I walked back to the main road, a spectre in soaked, torn clothes.
The first bus of the morning was idling at a stop. I boarded it, drawing
stares from the cleaner on his way to work. I didn’t care.</p>
<p>Back at the shophouse, in the grey dawn light, I peeled off my filthy
clothes. The cut on my ribs was long but shallow. I cleaned it, the
sting a bright, clean pain. I showered until the hot water ran out,
scrubbing at the smell of the drain.</p>
<p>In my room, I opened my backpack. The wooden box was there, cool and
silent. I placed it on the desk. I took out the map, still dry in its
plastic sleeve. My hands were steady as I unrolled it.</p>
<p>I did not mark the chamber in Toa Payoh. I did not need to. It was
not a parcel to be tended. It was a node. A presence. And I knew, with a
certainty that settled in my bones like a sediment, that it was not the
only one.</p>
<p>The map was not a record of solved silences. It was an index of
inhabitants.</p>
<p>My phone, charging on the floor, buzzed. Not a message. A calendar
notification, one I had not set.</p>
<p>It was for today. 11:00 AM. <em>The address: 22 Amber Road. The
custodians are ready.</em></p>
<p>Below the notification, a single line of text appeared, as if typed
by the air itself.</p>
<p><em>The needle must meet the weaver.</em></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-22-1"><strong>Chapter 22</strong></h2>
<p>The notification on my phone was a cold, bright eye in the dim room.
It held none of the ambiguity of Auntie Li’s missing frog, none of the
cryptic poetry of the old man’s warnings. It was an appointment. A
summons. The text hovered, a line of pure statement against the digital
white. <em>The needle must meet the weaver.</em></p>
<p>The map lay before me, a landscape of my own making. The marks were
no longer just Xs. They were notations. The red pin in Bukit Brown was a
vigil. The blue cross in Tiong Bahru was a suture. The chamber in Toa
Payoh, unmarked, was a deep, cold pressure on the paper, a watermark of
presence I could feel through the desk. The map was no longer a guide.
It was a diagnosis. And this new address, 22 Amber Road, was a point of
incision.</p>
<p>I dressed in clean, dark clothes. The cut on my ribs pulled, a tight,
clean reminder. I placed the wooden box in the centre of the map, my two
silent tools. The bus ride to the East Coast was a study in contrast.
The sky was a hard, tropical blue, scrubbed clean of the night’s storm.
The light was brutal, revealing. It showed the cracks in the pavement,
the faded paint on bus-stop benches, the determined green of trees
fighting through concrete. This was the waking world, solid and
indifferent. But beneath its drumming rhythm, I could now hear the other
score. The low hum of a transformer was not just electricity; it was a
strained chord. The distant wail of a siren was a thin, searching
thread. The world had become a palimpsest, and I was learning to read
the older, fainter text beneath.</p>
<p>Amber Road was a quiet stretch of landed houses nestled between the
roar of the parkway and the whisper of the sea. Number 22 was not a
shophouse, not an HDB block. It was a <em>black-and-white</em>, a
colonial-era bungalow, crouched behind a screen of rain trees and ferns.
Its timber frame was white, peeling. Its roof was dark terracotta tile.
It looked asleep, abandoned to the humidity and the roots that pressed
against its foundations. But the gate, wrought iron and heavy, was not
rusted shut. It swung inward at my touch, its hinge issuing a long, low
groan that was less sound and more vibration, a bass note felt in the
teeth.</p>
<p>The path to the door was paved with moss-slicked bricks. The garden
was not tended, but it was not wild. It was <em>occupied</em>. Clumps of
ginger flower grew in deliberate, too-perfect circles. A stand of bamboo
formed a dense, whispering wall that blocked the view of the neighbours.
The air here was different. It was still, thick, layered. The salt from
the sea was there, and the damp earth, and over it all, the cloying,
funeral-parlour sweetness of <em>cempaka</em> blossoms. No bird
sang.</p>
<p>The front door was teak, black with age. There was no bell. As I
raised my hand to knock, the door opened.</p>
<p>The woman who stood there was old, but her age was not a
diminishment. It was an accumulation, like the layers of nacre on a
pearl. Her hair was a cloud of white, held back by a simple jade pin.
She wore a <em>cheongsam</em> of dove-grey silk, unadorned. Her eyes
were the colour of weak tea, and they held no surprise.</p>
<p>“You are punctual,” she said. Her voice was dry, precise, the accent
an old Singapore, one of dictionaries and strict grammar. “Come in. They
are waiting.”</p>
<p>The ‘they’ hung in the air. I stepped over the threshold.</p>
<p>The interior was a shock of cool, dim space after the hammering light
outside. It was not furnished like a home. It was a repository. The high
ceilings were lost in shadow. Wooden cabinets, dark and glass-fronted,
lined the walls, filled with indistinct shapes: ceramic jars, rolled
scrolls, tarnished metal instruments. The air smelled of camphor,
sandalwood, and the faint, metallic tang of old ink. In the centre of
the wide, empty room was a single, long table of polished
<em>chengal</em> wood. Around it sat three other people.</p>
<p>An old Malay man in a crisp, white <em>songkok</em> and a light grey
<em>baju</em>. His hands, resting on the table, were maps of veins and
tendons. A Indian woman, perhaps in her sixties, her silver hair in a
severe bun, a deep red <em>bindi</em> like a drop of blood on her
forehead. And a younger Chinese man, my age perhaps, wearing a simple
black T-shirt and jeans, his expression carefully, professionally
blank.</p>
<p>The woman who let me in glided to the head of the table. “Sit,” she
said, indicating the empty chair at the foot.</p>
<p>I sat. The wooden box in my backpack felt suddenly heavy, a
lodestone. The map in its tube was a scroll of accusations.</p>
<p>“I am Mdm. Lim,” the woman said. She did not gesture to the others.
“You have been busy. You have visited the quiet places. You have spoken
to the guardians. You have… intervened.” She said the last word as if it
were a clinical term, with neither approval nor disapproval.</p>
<p>“The old man at the dragon kiln,” I said. My voice sounded too loud
in the hushed room. “He said you were custodians.”</p>
<p>The Malay man nodded once. “We are. Of the territory. Not of the
places themselves. The places have their own keepers. The frog, the
potter, the <em>pakcik</em> in the forest. We are the weavers.” He
tapped a long finger on the table. “The map, please.”</p>
<p>It was not a request. I unzipped my backpack, withdrew the plastic
tube, and slid out the map. I unrolled it on the table, using the wooden
box at one corner and an empty teacup at another to hold it flat. The
four of them leaned forward, not with curiosity, but with the focused
attention of surgeons viewing a scan.</p>
<p>The Indian woman, her eyes sharp behind her glasses, traced a line
from Bukit Brown to Tiong Bahru with a fingernail. “Clean work. A little
rough at the edges, but the thread is whole.” She looked at me. “You
used the silence as a guide. Not as a weapon. This is good.”</p>
<p>“What is this?” I asked, my hand sweeping over the map. “What are
these… nodes? These presences?”</p>
<p>The younger man spoke for the first time. His voice was quiet,
measured. “Singapore is a young country built on very old land. The
stories here are deep. Some are sleeping. Some are… restless. Some are
wounded. The silences you hear, the hums you feel—they are the symptoms.
A healthy story is quiet, integrated. It hums at a frequency that
sustains. A broken one screams, or it goes cold. It creates a tear in
the territory.”</p>
<p>Mdm. Lim took over. “Our work is maintenance. We monitor. We listen.
When a thread frays, we send a needle to re-knit it. The guardians—the
local keepers—they are the fabric. We are the hands that repair.”</p>
<p>“And the boy? Mei?” The questions were piling up in my throat. “The
chamber in Toa Payoh?”</p>
<p>“A complication,” the Malay man said, his face grave. “The boy was a
sensitive. He heard the call of a wounded, hungry story—the thing in the
chamber. It was using his grief for his sister as a bridge, a way to
taste the waking world. You were the needle drawn to that tear. You
reconnected the living thread—the sibling bond—and it strengthened the
fabric enough to push the presence back into its node. For now.”</p>
<p>“It’s not gone.” “No,” said the Indian woman. “Such things are rarely
gone. They are managed. Contained. Or, in very rare cases, reconciled.
Your intervention was a temporary suture. The weaver—the entity in the
chamber—is still there. It is aware of you now.”</p>
<p>A cold trickle, unrelated to the room’s cool air, went down my spine.
<em>You are the needle.</em></p>
<p>“Why me?” The hollow ringing I’d felt at Spottiswoode Park was back,
but it was filled now with a dreadful, specific gravity. “I didn’t ask
for this. I just… heard things.”</p>
<p>Mdm. Lim’s tea-coloured eyes held mine. “You did not ask. But you
came. You unmoored yourself. You arrived at a place of waiting, empty
enough to be filled. The territory is a living system. It seeks balance.
When a needle is needed, it calls one. Sometimes it is one of us,
trained from youth.” She glanced at the young man. “Sometimes, it is a
stranger who arrives at the right moment, hollowed out by their own
life, perfectly shaped to hold the point.”</p>
<p>The revelation was not dramatic. It was osmotic. It seeped into the
spaces between my bones. My leaving London, the hollow jet lag, the
search for a story—it had not been an escape. It had been a vector. I
had been called. I was a tool that had walked to the hand that needed
it.</p>
<p>“The calendar notification,” I said. “You sent it.” “The territory
sent it,” corrected the young man. “We merely facilitate the interface.
You had reached a threshold. The initial… adjustments were complete. You
needed context. Purpose. Otherwise, the knowing would drive you mad, or
make you dangerous.”</p>
<p>I looked at their faces, this council of weavers in their silent
house. They were not benevolent mentors. They were mechanics.
Archivists. They spoke of stories and territories with the detached
passion of engineers discussing a complex, fragile machine.</p>
<p>“What do you want from me?” My voice was flat. “A choice,” Mdm. Lim
said. She placed both her palms flat on the table. “You can walk out of
this house. We will give you something—a tea, a ritual—that will dampen
your sensitivity. The hums will fade. The silences will become just
silence. You will live in the single-layered world. You will forget the
texture of the map. You will be safe.”</p>
<p>The word <em>safe</em> hung in the camphor-scented air. It felt
small. Brittle. “Or?” I asked. “Or,” said the Malay man, “you pick up
your needle. You learn its weight, its purpose. You become an active
thread in the weave. You help us maintain the balance. You repair what
is broken, and guard against what seeks to break in.”</p>
<p>“It is not a gentle path,” the Indian woman warned. “You have seen a
fraction. The territories are not all sad children and lonely spirits.
There are older hungers. There are tears that do not want to be mended.
There is a cost to holding the point.”</p>
<p>I looked down at my map. At my mark in Bukit Brown, where I had
simply listened. At the blue cross in Tiong Bahru, where I had followed
a thread of sound to its source. At the unmarked, cold weight of Toa
Payoh, where I had been used as a tool by a will greater than my own.
The map was no longer a mystery to be solved. It was a work order.</p>
<p>I had spent my life collecting other people’s stories, holding them
at arm’s length, shaping them into narratives that were neat, that had
arcs. Here was a story that was raw, unshaped, and alive. It was not
something to be written about. It was something to be <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I did not feel brave. I felt resigned. I felt, for the first time
since arriving in this humid, drumming city, a sense of dreadful
fit.</p>
<p>“The chamber,” I said, meeting Mdm. Lim’s gaze. “The weaver there.
It’s aware of me. If I walk away, what happens?”</p>
<p>The young man answered. “It may lose interest. Or, it may perceive
you as an unfinished connection, a loose end. It could try to pull the
thread from a distance. Your dampened sensitivity would make you deaf to
its approach. You would be vulnerable.”</p>
<p>So there was no real choice. Not really. Safety was an illusion they
offered out of courtesy. The path forked, but both roads led into the
same dark wood. One, I walked blind. The other, I walked with a needle
in my hand.</p>
<p>I reached out and touched the cool, silent wood of my box. I thought
of the old potter’s hands, guiding the scooter into the dawn. I thought
of Mei’s small, cold hand in mine, and the profound rightness of her
brother’s grip replacing it. That was the work. Not the mystery, not the
fear. The re-knitting.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay,” I said. The words were not grand. They were an
admission.</p>
<p>Mdm. Lim gave a slow, single nod. No smile. No welcome.
Acknowledgment. “Then the apprenticeship begins now. You are not a
student. You are a probationary needle. You will assist. You will learn.
You will be tested.” She gestured to the young man. “This is Arjun. He
will be your primary contact. Your… handler.”</p>
<p>Arjun offered the faintest of nods. His eyes were assessing,
calculating my weight, my density.</p>
<p>The Malay man, whom they called Pak Ali, rolled up my map with
practised ease. “This is now a working document. You will update it
after every engagement. Not with your feelings. With data. Location,
time, nature of the disturbance, action taken, result. Clarity is your
shield.”</p>
<p>The Indian woman, Dr. Sharma, stood. “Come. Your first lesson is in
perception. You have heard silences and hums. Now you must learn to
listen to the <em>texture</em> of a place. To diagnose before you
prescribe.”</p>
<p>For the next three hours, they schooled me. It was not esoteric. It
was brutally practical. Dr. Sharma taught me to distinguish between the
benign ‘sleeping’ silence of an old, settled spirit and the predatory
‘hungry’ silence of something like the chamber. Pak Ali showed me, using
a series of old, hand-drawn diagrams, how human emotion—particularly
concentrated grief, anger, or fear—could strain the local territory,
creating thin spots, making it vulnerable. Arjun spoke of logistics:
safe houses, code phrases, how to access certain restricted areas
without drawing official attention.</p>
<p>Mdm. Lim watched, interjecting only occasionally to refine a point.
“You are a tool,” she said once, cutting off my question about the
origin of the entities. “A plumber does not need to know the history of
the water to fix a leak. He needs to know the pipe, the wrench, the
sealant. Know your tools. Know the fabric. The rest is philosophy, and
philosophy will not stop a territory from unravelling.”</p>
<p>As the afternoon light began to slant through the high, dusty
windows, painting bars of gold across the dark floor, Mdm. Lim rose.
“Enough. Theory is a skeleton. It needs the flesh of practice.” She
looked at Arjun. “There is the matter in Geylang. The <em>dangdut</em>
club. The reports are consistent. A cold spot that moves. Patrons feel
a… draining. Followed by irrational rage. Two fights last week, severe.
The local keeper is concerned.”</p>
<p>Arjun stood, smooth and efficient. “The music is loud. The emotions
are high. It is a rich feeding ground for a certain type of fragment.”
He looked at me. “You will observe. You will listen. You will not
intervene unless I instruct. Understood?”</p>
<p>I nodded. The weight of the box in my backpack felt different now. It
was no longer a found object. It was issued equipment.</p>
<p>We left the black-and-white house as quietly as we had entered. The
garden’s <em>cempaka</em> scent was cloying in the late heat. The world
outside the gate seemed louder, cruder, a blinding barrage of sensation.
But I could now see the seams. I could feel, like a faint static on my
skin, the larger, quieter grid overlaid upon it.</p>
<p>Arjun drove a nondescript silver sedan. He did not speak as we
navigated towards Geylang. The silence was not uncomfortable; it was
operational.</p>
<p>“The custodians,” I said finally, as we stopped at a traffic light.
“How many of you are there?” “Enough,” he said. “We are not an
organisation. We are a function. Some, like the elders, are full-time.
Others, like me, have lives in the world. We are called when
needed.”</p>
<p>“And the territories… the stories. Are they all… dangerous?”
“No. Most are just old. Sad, sometimes. Lonely. They are part of the
landscape. We only intervene when they become parasitic, or when the
living world threatens to destroy them and create a backlash. Balance.”
He said the word like a mantra.</p>
<p>Geylang in the late afternoon was a beast stirring from its sleep.
The neon signs for lor mee and frog leg porridge were still off, but the
shops were open, and the rhythmic clatter of mahjong tiles from upstairs
windows provided a percussive backdrop. Arjun parked down a side lane
behind a row of shophouses whose backs were stained with water leakage
and the ghostly outlines of removed air-con units.</p>
<p>“The club is through there,” he said, pointing to a narrow alley
between two buildings. “It opens at nine. The effects are reported to
start around eleven, peak at one. We go in early. We find a corner. We
listen.”</p>
<p>We entered through a back door that Arjun unlocked with a key from a
large, jangling ring. The interior of the club was a cave of velvet and
cheap chrome. It smelled of stale beer, industrial cleaner, and beneath
it, a sour note of old sweat and spilled sweetness. The air was cold
from overworked air-conditioning. A stage stood empty at one end, a
glittering disco ball hanging above it like a dormant chrysalis.</p>
<p>“Here,” Arjun said, choosing a booth in a corner far from the stage,
with a good view of the main floor and the long bar. “Order a drink.
Sit. Listen. Tell me what you feel. Not what you think. What you
<em>feel</em> in your bones, in your teeth.”</p>
<p>We sat. A bored waitress took our order for two Tigers. When they
came, condensation beading on the bottles, I tried to settle into the
space. I closed my eyes, letting the obvious sounds recede: the hum of
the fridge, the distant kitchen noises, the thump of bass from the club
next door.</p>
<p>At first, there was just the blank, empty silence of a place not yet
alive. A waiting room. Then, as I tuned deeper, I began to feel the
residues. Flickers of past laughter, sharp and bright like splintered
glass. The low, throbbing ache of countless nights of loneliness. A
greasy smear of desperation. These were not entities; they were echoes,
emotional stains on the fabric of the place.</p>
<p>And then I found it. Not a sound. A <em>suck</em>.</p>
<p>It was in the far corner, near the fire exit. A patch of space that
felt… thin. Insatiable. It wasn’t cold, like the chamber. It was numb.
It pulled at the edges of my awareness, a gentle, relentless drain. I
opened my eyes.</p>
<p>“There,” I whispered, nodding towards the corner. “Near the exit.
It’s hungry. Not for attention. For… feeling. For heat.”</p>
<p>Arjun followed my gaze, his expression unchanged. “Good. That is the
fragment. It is a leech. It attaches itself to places of high, unguarded
emotion and feeds on the spillage. The fights happen because it drains
the joy, the social warmth, leaving only the raw, irritable nerves
beneath. People become dry tinder.”</p>
<p>“How do you fix it?” “You don’t <em>fix</em> a leech. You remove it.
You give it a better target.” From his jacket pocket, he withdrew a
small, polished brass vessel, like a tiny urn, sealed with a wax
stopper. He placed it on the table. “This contains a concentrated charge
of <em>sehnsucht</em>—wistful longing. A potent, bittersweet emotion. We
will lure it, trap it, and release it in a neutral territory where it
can dissipate slowly, harmlessly.”</p>
<p>The club began to fill. The lights dimmed, and coloured spots began
to sweep the dance floor. The music started, a pounding, infectious
<em>dangdut</em> rhythm. The air grew thick with bodies, perfume,
cigarette smoke, and the rising tide of released energy. Laughter,
shouts, the clink of glasses. The emotional temperature soared.</p>
<p>And the numb, sucking patch in the corner began to move.</p>
<p>It was slow, drifting like an oil slick on water. It would hover near
a group of laughing men, and their laughter would become just a touch
too loud, too forced, then die into bickering. It would pass by a
couple, and their intimate whispers would turn into sharp, hissed
arguments. I could see it now, not with my eyes, but as a distortion in
the fabric of the room, a lens that warped warmth into friction.</p>
<p>“Now,” Arjun said, his voice low. He unstoppered the brass
vessel.</p>
<p>Nothing visible emerged. But I felt it. A wave of profound, aching
sweetness, a memory of a lost home you never had. It was beautiful and
devastating. Arjun placed the open vessel on the floor by our booth.</p>
<p>The leech-fragment halted its drift across the room. It seemed to
tremble, to orient itself. The sucking sensation intensified, now
focused, single-minded. It began to flow across the floor, a hungry
current, towards the source of the rich, melancholic feast.</p>
<p>As it reached the vessel, the air around it seemed to contract. The
sounds from the nearby dancers muted, as if heard through glass. The
fragment poured itself into the small brass opening, a silent, greedy
ingestion. Arjun leaned down swiftly and pressed the wax stopper back in
place with a firm, final click.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate. The numb pressure vanished. The club’s
atmosphere didn’t become joyful, but the irritant was gone. The emotions
in the room were just human emotions again, volatile but not poisoned. A
couple who had been scowling at each other blinked, shook their heads,
and shared a confused, then genuine, smile.</p>
<p>“Clean extraction,” Arjun said, pocketing the vessel. “Observation
period is over. We go.”</p>
<p>We left through the back alley. The night air of Geylang was a
relief, a chaotic but honest assault of smells and sounds. In the car,
Arjun was silent for a long moment.</p>
<p>“You perceived it correctly. You diagnosed its nature. This is good.”
He started the engine. “But perception is the smallest part. The next
time, you will hold the vessel. You will choose the moment. You will
seal the catch.”</p>
<p>He drove me back to Spottiswoode Park. As I got out, he handed me a
small, blank notebook. “For your data. Start with tonight. Objective
details only.” He looked at me, and for a second, the professional mask
slipped, revealing something tired, something old. “The map is not a
record of your journey. It is a ledger of your debts. Remember
that.”</p>
<p>He drove away, leaving me standing under the five-foot way. The
shophouse was dark. The street was quiet. I climbed the stairs to my
room, my mind buzzing with protocols and perceptions, with the feel of
that sucking numbness and the clever, cruel beauty of the bait.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk. I opened the notebook. I wrote: <em>Location:
Geylang, Dangdut Club “Rindu”. Time: 2100-2300. Disturbance: Mobile
emotional leech-fragment, feeding on social heat, causing agitation.
Action: Lured with concentrated wistfulness (vessel #4), contained.
Result: Fragment neutralized, atmosphere normalized.</em></p>
<p>The words were dry. Clinical. They contained nothing of the pounding
music, the smell of spilled beer, the couple’s reconciling smile. This
was the work. The reduction of experience to data.</p>
<p>I looked at my map, still on the desk where Pak Ali had left it. I
took a blue pencil—for contained entities—and made a small, precise mark
at the location of the club. Not an X. A circle. Contained.</p>
<p>The map was indeed a ledger. And I had just entered my first official
transaction.</p>
<p>I lay in bed, the cut on my ribs a faint, familiar ache. The silence
of my room was no longer just an absence of sound. It was a canvas. I
could feel the gentle, sleeping hum of the shophouse itself, the
residual warmth of Auntie Li’s family history in the walls. I could feel
the distant, sleeping nodes marked on my map, each a different texture,
a different pressure. And I could feel, like a bruise on the edge of my
awareness, the cold, deep presence in Toa Payoh. The weaver. Aware of
me.</p>
<p>I was no longer a spectator, a collector of stories. I was a
participant. A needle, now in the hand of weavers. The apprenticeship
had begun. The work was endless. And as I drifted towards sleep, the
last thought that coiled through my mind was not of leeches or
fragments, but of Mdm. Lim’s words, spoken with the weight of a
verdict.</p>
<p><em>Philosophy will not stop a territory from unravelling.</em></p>
<p>But something would. And that something, now, included me. The weight
of it was immense. It was the only thing that felt real.</p>
<p>My phone, on the bedside table, lit up. Not a calendar alert. A
message from an unknown number. Arjun.</p>
<p><em>Tomorrow. 3 PM. Meet at the old Bidadari cemetery gates. A vigil
has gone silent. We need to hear why.</em></p>
<p>Below the text, as if the territory itself was dictating the terms,
my calendar updated automatically. An appointment, solid and unmovable,
in the world of glass and light.</p>
<p>The needle had been threaded. The next stitch was waiting.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-23-1"><strong>Chapter 23</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. But the rain in Bidadari was
a memory. It fell as a kind of atmospheric echo, a dampness in the soil
that had no business being there, a chill that clung to the bones long
after the sun had baked the city’s concrete. The old cemetery gates were
not gates at all, but a suggestion. Two moss-stained pillars of
whitewashed brick, standing sentinel over a carpet of manicured grass.
The graves were gone, exhumed, the land sleeping now between lives. It
was a territory of silence, but not an empty one. It was a silence that
listened.</p>
<p>I stood at the threshold, my shadow a stark, short thing in the
afternoon glare. The map was a weight in my bag, not paper, but in my
mind. I could feel the nodes: the cold anchor in Toa Payoh, the quiet
hum of my shophouse, the newly-circled club in Holland Village. And
here, a different texture. A muffled quality. A vigil gone silent. I
understood the terminology now. A vigil was a story held in place by
collective attention, a candle-flame of narrative kept burning to mark a
loss, a hope, a protest. For it to go silent was not for people to
leave. It was for the story to be un-told, the memory-hole to open, and
for the leeches to begin their slow, patient work of consumption.</p>
<p>Arjun was already there, leaning against one of the pillars. He
looked carved from the same weathered stone. His usual sharpness was
blunted, his eyes not scanning but settled, heavy.</p>
<p>“You felt it,” he said. It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>I nodded. The air tasted of cut grass and disturbed earth. “It’s not
just quiet. It’s… padded.”</p>
<p>“A soundproof room,” he said, pushing off the pillar. “They set up a
vigil here three weeks ago. For a child. A hit-and-run on the adjacent
road. The driver never stopped. The parents, they came every evening.
Lit a candle. Told stories. Passers-by would stop. Leave a toy. A note.
The story was being held. It was a small, sad knot, but it was
tight.”</p>
<p>He began walking onto the grass, and I followed. Our footsteps were
swallowed by the soft ground.</p>
<p>“And then?” I asked, though I could feel the ‘then’ in the air. A
residue of something sweet turned sour.</p>
<p>“Four days ago, the parents stopped coming. The candles, the toys,
the notes… they remained. But the story left. The ritual became just
objects. Then yesterday, the objects were gone, too. City cleanup,
supposedly. But the silence that moved in wasn’t the silence of absence.
It was the silence of a finished meal.”</p>
<p>We stopped in the centre of the field. There was nothing to see. No
scorch mark, no depression in the grass. But the space between my
shoulder blades itched. This was a site of erasure. A story had been
carefully, surgically removed. Not fragmented, not shattered, but
extracted. The precision of it was more frightening than any chaotic
unraveling I’d witnessed.</p>
<p>“A weaver’s work,” I said, my voice low.</p>
<p>Arjun’s jaw tightened. “This signature is… clinical. The vigil was a
tender thing. To unpick it without a single thread snapping? That takes
a cold, steady hand. The opposite of a fragment’s hunger. This is
curation. This is archiving.”</p>
<p>The thought was ice in my gut. “They’re not just containing
eruptions. They’re collecting the stories.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and his gaze was a confirmation. “The map is a
ledger. You understood that. But a ledger records debits and credits.
What is the currency? What is the balance being sought?”</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking, once a passive, aching hunger in me, was now a
focused dread. I was not seeking meaning. I was auditing it. I was
standing in a blank space where meaning had been deleted from the
ledger. The philosophy of it—the why—was a luxury that crumbled here, on
this sanitized grass. Mdm. Lim was right. Philosophy would not stop
this. Only a more potent story could.</p>
<p>“We need to hear why it went silent,” I said, echoing his text. “But
the parents are gone. The story is gone.”</p>
<p>“The story is gone,” Arjun agreed. “But the space it occupied isn’t.
It’s a vacuum. And in my experience, vacuums in places like this… they
record.”</p>
<p>He knelt, placing his palms flat on the grass. He closed his eyes. I
watched the lines of his face go slack, then deepen, as if listening to
a frequency pitched below hearing. This was his apprenticeship, his
craft. Not needles and threads, but ears for the echoes.</p>
<p>I stood guard, the city’s hum a distant wall beyond the green. My own
senses, raw and new, stretched out. I felt the sleeping nodes, the
gentle pressures. And I felt the deep, cold presence in Toa Payoh. It
was not focused here, not exactly. But it was… aware. A librarian noting
a volume had been checked out.</p>
<p>Arjun shuddered, a full-body tremor that seemed to start from the
earth and move through him. He pulled his hands back as if burned,
though the grass was cool.</p>
<p>“Well?” I asked.</p>
<p>He stood, wiping his palms on his trousers. His face was pale. “It
wasn’t a persuasion. It wasn’t a threat. It was a trade.”</p>
<p>“A trade?”</p>
<p>“The weaver came to them. Offered them a perfect copy of their
child’s story. A clean, painless version. The driver stops. The
ambulance comes. The child lives. A story of trauma, rewritten as a
story of miraculous recovery. All the love, none of the grief. A sealed
loop. A perfect, contained memory. In exchange, they had to relinquish
the original. The true story. The vigil. The public mourning. They had
to give up the ragged edges, the unanswered questions, the collective
anger. They took the copy and walked away.”</p>
<p>The horror of it was absolute. It was not violence. It was mercy,
weaponized. It was the ultimate spiritual seduction: the offer of a
painless past. Who would refuse? What parent, drowning in the acid of
unjust loss, would not reach for that lifeline? The weaver hadn’t stolen
their story. They had bought it. With counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>“That’s the balance,” I whispered, the understanding a sickness in
me. “They’re not just maintaining stability. They’re trading messy,
painful, true stories for clean, palatable fictions. They’re rewriting
the territory’s ledger. Sanitizing its history.”</p>
<p>Arjun nodded, grim. “And the true stories? The originals? Where do
they go? What does a weaver <em>do</em> with a concentrated dose of
pure, unadulterated grief?”</p>
<p>The answer hung in the padded silence around us. They didn’t discard
them. A collector does not throw away the prize. They stored them. They
used them. Fuel. Weapon. Exhibit. The purpose was still opaque, but the
mechanism was now horrifically clear. The weavers were surgeons of
memory, and their payment was in raw, human truth.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed in my pocket. Not Arjun. I pulled it out. The screen
showed a notification from a local news aggregator. A headline.</p>
<p><strong>Community Joy: Toa Payoh Heritage Hub Announces “Memory Well”
Installation. A digital archive of neighbourhood stories, launching this
weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Below the text was a rendering: a sleek, dark plinth in the centre of
the new community plaza, the one built over the old, contested ground.
The plaza that sat directly above the cold, deep presence on my map. The
Memory Well.</p>
<p>“They’re not just collecting,” I said, showing Arjun the screen.
“They’re preparing to display.”</p>
<p>He stared at the rendering, his expression hardening into something
like despair. “A well. You drop a story in. You get back… what? The
sanitized version? The original becomes a data point in their archive,
and the public gets the curated copy. It’s a filtration system. For the
entire neighbourhood’s soul.”</p>
<p>The scale of it crashed down. This wasn’t about a single vigil. This
was a pilot project. A proof of concept. The Bidadari extraction was a
test. The Memory Well was the rollout.</p>
<p>“We have to stop the launch,” I said. The words felt childish,
absurd. Stop a community event? With what? Our profound discomfort?</p>
<p>“How?” Arjun’s voice was flat. “We walk in and tell people their
cherished memories are being processed into propaganda? They’ll think
we’re mad. And the weavers… they are the authorities here. They are the
stability. We are the fragments.”</p>
<p>It was the darkest moment. Every thread led to destruction. The
weavers were not monsters in the shadows; they were the architects in
the light, offering peace, order, clean narratives. Who would fight
against that? My own role was a grotesque joke. A needle, threaded to
mend tears in reality, only to discover the master weavers were the ones
carefully, lovingly, unraveling the truest parts of the tapestry and
replacing them with impeccable forgeries.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeking turned inward, a frantic pulse. What was I
seeking? Not a god, not a truth. A lever. A story strong enough to
challenge a perfect lie.</p>
<p>I thought of Auntie Li’s shophouse, its walls holding the warmth of
family history, unvarnished and complete. I thought of the couple in the
club, their reconciliation a private, messy truth. I thought of my own
unmoored state, the bruise-coloured suitcase, the key under the frog. My
story had no clean version. It was all ragged edges and unanswered
questions. It was real.</p>
<p>“We don’t stop the launch,” I heard myself say. The idea formed like
a crystal in the cold of my dread. “We contaminate it.”</p>
<p>Arjun looked at me. “Explain.”</p>
<p>“The Memory Well is a filter. It takes in true stories and outputs
clean ones. What if we give it a story that can’t be cleaned? A story
that’s all edge. A story that, if you try to rewrite it, unravels the
rewrite.”</p>
<p>“A paradox,” he murmured. “A narrative fragment. But a controlled
one. You want to introduce a virus.”</p>
<p>“Not a virus. A mirror.” The plan, desperate and half-formed, gained
a terrible clarity. “The weaver in Toa Payoh. He knew my grandfather.
There’s a story there, a true one, that connects to me. He’s collected
so much. What if his own story—the true, messy, human story of why he
does this—is fed into his own machine? What if the Memory Well is asked
to process the weaver’s own grief, his own guilt?”</p>
<p>Arjun was silent for a long time, the memory-laden breeze stirring
his hair. “It’s a suicide run. To get that story, you’d have to go to
the source. To him. You’d have to walk into the heart of his territory
and… what? Ask him to confess?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The seed planted in the darkness began to sprout, a
sharp, thorny thing. “I don’t ask. I listen. Every story leaves a trace.
You heard the echo of a trade here. His story is in the walls of that
place, in the cold at the centre of his web. I’m a needle. I’m designed
to find tears, to feel tensions. I’ll find the tear in <em>him</em>. The
original wound he’s trying to sew over with everyone else’s
stories.”</p>
<p>“He’ll feel you the moment you start probing,” Arjun warned. “It will
be an act of war.”</p>
<p>“It already is,” I said, looking out at the blank, listening field of
Bidadari. “He just hasn’t bothered to declare it. I’m not a soldier. I’m
a loose thread. And I’m going to snag on his masterpiece.”</p>
<p>Arjun studied me, and I saw a shift in his eyes. From despair to a
grim, resigned calculation. He saw the logic. It was the only move left
on a board that was already tilted against us.</p>
<p>“You’ll need a distraction. For the launch event. Something to pull
his attention, to thin his focus.”</p>
<p>“I have an idea for that, too,” I said, thinking of Mdm. Lim’s stern
face, her network of taxi-uncles and coffee-shop aunties who knew the
value of a story that belonged to you. “But I’ll need your help to get
in. Not through the front door.”</p>
<p>He gave a slow, single nod. A pact, sealed on gravesite grass. “I
know a way. The old storm drains. They run beneath the plaza. They were
part of the territory’s old anatomy. He may have sealed them, but… seals
can be broken.”</p>
<p>We left Bidadari as the evening began to bleed the colour from the
sky. The silence followed us to the gates, then released us back into
the city’s drumming hum. The return to Spottiswoode Park felt like
crossing a border into a fragile ally. The shophouse welcomed me with
its familiar, sleeping warmth. But it felt smaller now. A safe house on
the edge of a battlefield.</p>
<p>I did not sleep. I sat at the desk, Pak Ali’s map before me. I took a
red pencil—for active, unresolved tensions—and drew a small, careful
circle around the Toa Payoh plaza. Then I drew a line, in blue, from the
Bidadari pillar to it. A transaction. A credit transferred.</p>
<p>Then I did something I had not done before. I took a black pencil,
one I had never used. And in the margin of the map, I began to write.
Not coordinates. Not notations. Fragments of my own story. The
bruise-coloured suitcase. The missing frog. The hollow ringing of jet
lag. The smell of frangipani and wet asphalt. The unasked question of
why I had really come. I wrote until the margin was a dark, messy cloud
of text. My own vigil. My own true, un-sanitized story. If I was going
to use myself as a mirror, I had to remember what I reflected.</p>
<p>The night deepened. The cut on my ribs was a silent companion. The
cold presence in Toa Payoh was a constant pressure on the edge of my
mind, a lighthouse in a frozen sea. I did not try to hide from it. I let
my own ragged narrative hum softly, a counter-frequency.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, my phone lit up. A message from Mdm. Lim. No
greeting.</p>
<p><em>The old stories are the strongest. The taxi stand has a queue for
the Memory Well. They are offering free rides to seniors to bring their
stories. A generous offer. Too generous. My friends will be there. They
will have stories to tell. They will take their time.</em></p>
<p>A distraction. A queue of authentic, garrulous, inconvenient
humanity, flooding the intake of the Well with stories too vibrant, too
idiosyncratic, to be quickly processed. It was perfect.</p>
<p>I replied with two words. <em>Thank you.</em></p>
<p>Her response was immediate. <em>Philosophy will not stop them. But
stubbornness might.</em></p>
<p>I put the phone down. The first grey light was tracing the window
bars. The appointment in my calendar for the Memory Well launch glowed,
an unblinking eye. I had until tomorrow.</p>
<p>The needle had been threaded with a thread of my own making. The next
stitch would be an act of sabotage, sewn from the inside out. The
spiritual seeking was over. I had found what I sought. It was not peace,
not truth. It was a weapon. And it was myself.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, not to sleep, but to listen. To feel for the tear
in the world that was a man, and the story he had buried so deep he
thought it was gone. Tomorrow, I would go digging. And we would see
which of us was the stronger story.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-24-1"><strong>Chapter 24</strong></h2>
<p>The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. It doesn’t fall so much as it
arrives, a sudden, silver wall that erases the towers of the new city
and turns the world into a drum. I stood under the five-foot way of a
shophouse on Amoy Street, a different covered walkway, a different space
for waiting. The air smelled of wet asphalt, <em>kopi</em>, and the
faint, ghostly sweetness of frangipani from a tree someone had tried to
grow in a crack in the pavement. I had no suitcase. The hollow ringing
in my bones was not jet lag, but the aftermath of a vigil, the residue
of a story told in ink and silence. I was waiting for the rain to thin,
for a break in the percussion, so I could walk the final five hundred
metres to the door.</p>
<p>The door today was not 28B Spottiswoode Park Road. It was the glass
and steel atrium of the Memory Well’s public launch, a temple of curated
nostalgia. My appointment glowed in my calendar, that unblinking eye.
Mdm. Lim’s message was a live wire in my pocket. <em>The taxi stand has
a queue.</em> A weapon of mass inconvenience, forged from stubbornness
and free rides. My own weapon was quieter, colder. It was the story I
had exhumed from myself in the dark, the one I would use to dig for
his.</p>
<p>The rain slackened from a wall to a curtain, then to a persistent
mist. I stepped out into it. Let it bead on my skin. The city that had
been a blur of alien humidity and sharp edges nine months ago was now a
map scored into me. I knew the pressure of the cold spot in Toa Payoh
like a missing tooth I could probe with my tongue. I knew the weight of
the humid air in the Bukit Brown cemetery, the taste of old grief. I
knew the exact timbre of silence in Mdm. Lim’s front room. This was not
familiarity. It was inscription.</p>
<p>The atrium was a cathedral of light and sound, a deliberate assault
on the senses. Holographic projections of “shared memories” danced in
the air—generic celebrations, first days of school, wedding smiles that
never reached the eyes. The soundscape was a susurrus of crowd noise and
a saccharine, algorithmic score. It was the opposite of the five-foot
way. It offered no space for waiting, only consumption. A smiling
attendant in a cream-coloured tunic scanned my invitation.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Well,” she said, her voice as calibrated as the
music. “Your journey to deeper connection starts today.”</p>
<p>I moved through the crowd. It was a mix of tech investors in
open-collared shirts, government officials with careful smiles, and
early-adopter citizens, their faces lit by the glow of the complimentary
tablets they carried, already scrolling through the promotional memory
packs. I saw none of Mdm. Lim’s friends. Not yet.</p>
<p>He was at the centre of it all, standing on a low dais before a
shimmering representation of the Well’s core—a vortex of swirling,
golden light. Dr. Aris Thorne. He wore a tailored navy suit, the kind
that costs more than a year of Auntie Li’s rent. His silver hair was
perfect. His hands moved with a conductor’s grace as he explained the
technology to a rapt circle. He spoke of legacy, of healing the
fragmentation of modern life, of building a collective soul.</p>
<p>I watched him. I listened past the words to the rhythm beneath. The
careful modulation. The pauses that were just a fraction too long,
inviting admiration. This was his story, the one he had built over the
buried one. A story of genius, of benevolence, of a man who had
conquered personal tragedy to gift the world wholeness. The biography in
all the press kits. The car accident that took his wife and young
daughter. The years of grief, then the breakthrough. <em>From profound
loss, profound connection.</em></p>
<p>It was a good story. Clean. Sanitized. Powerful.</p>
<p>It was also, I now knew, a lie. Not in its facts, but in its soul.
The story he had buried was not the loss. It was the moment before.</p>
<p>I drifted closer, a ghost in the bright room. I let my own ragged
narrative hum, the one I’d scribbled in the dark. The bruise-coloured
suitcase. The missing frog. The unasked question. I didn’t try to quiet
it. I let it be a tuning fork, vibrating to a different frequency.</p>
<p>His eyes swept the room, acknowledging admirers. They passed over me,
paused, and returned. A flicker, there and gone. A recognition not of my
face, but of the frequency. I was a wrong note in his symphony. He gave
a final, beatific smile to his circle and stepped down, making his way
toward a side corridor marked ‘Private’.</p>
<p>I followed, not stealthily, but with the directness of someone who
belonged. The corridor was quieter, lined with framed patents and
awards. He stopped before a door, his keycard in hand.</p>
<p>“This area is for staff,” he said, without turning around. His voice
was still pleasant, but it had cooled by twenty degrees.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. “I wanted to see the engine room. The place where
the stories get cleaned.”</p>
<p>He turned then. His face was a mask of polite inquiry, but his eyes
were the colour of a winter sea. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. The
narrative integration core is highly sensitive. The launch presentation
is in the atrium. You’ll find everything you need there.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that.” I held his gaze. The hum inside me was louder now, a
vibration in my teeth. “I think what I need is in there. In the raw
intake. The stories before they’re… processed.”</p>
<p>A muscle in his jaw tightened. “The Well is designed to alleviate
pain, not to wallow in it. We honour memory by focusing on its essence,
not its trauma.”</p>
<p>“Whose pain?” I asked. The question hung in the sterile air of the
corridor. “Whose trauma are you alleviating?”</p>
<p>For the first time, his composure showed a crack. A faint, vertical
line appeared between his eyebrows. “Everyone’s. It’s our mission.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, my voice soft. “It’s your penance.”</p>
<p>The word landed in the silence like a stone in a still pool. His
expression didn’t change, but something behind his eyes shut down. A
portcullis slamming shut.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who you are or what you think you’re implying,” he
said, his voice now flat, metallic. “But this event is for guests, not
for amateur psychoanalysis. Security can show you out.”</p>
<p>He raised his hand, a small remote in his grip. I spoke before he
could press a button.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a car accident.”</p>
<p>My words were barely a whisper. They didn’t need to be loud. They
were a needle, and I had just found the seam.</p>
<p>He froze. The remote didn’t waver, but his breath caught, just
once.</p>
<p>“The official story,” I continued, the pieces Mdm. Lim’s stubborn
research and my own cold nights had unearthed clicking into place.
“Rain-slicked road. Oncoming lorry. A tragedy. But the weather report
for that district, that night, showed no rain. And the lorry driver’s
statement… it was never released. Sealed. A private settlement, far
beyond what was necessary.”</p>
<p>“Get out.” The words were gritted out.</p>
<p>“You were driving,” I said. I took a step closer. The pressure in the
corridor was immense, a psychic humidity. “You weren’t drunk. The tests
showed nothing. You were just… gone. A micro-sleep? A fugue? The report
speculated. But you know. You were chasing a thought. A breakthrough.
The kernel of the Well. You were so deep inside the architecture of
memory you forgot you were piloting a ton of metal at eighty kilometres
an hour. Your wife called your name. You didn’t hear her.”</p>
<p>“Stop.” It was not a command. It was a plea. The portcullis was bent,
groaning.</p>
<p>“The loss wasn’t the tragedy,” I said, the truth of it cold and sharp
in my mouth. “The tragedy was the moment before. The choice you made,
not between family and work, but between presence and abstraction. You
chose the abstraction. And they died for it.”</p>
<p>He made a sound, a low, wounded thing. The remote clattered to the
floor. He swayed, putting a hand against the wall to steady himself. The
great Dr. Aris Thorne, reduced to a man leaning on painted drywall.</p>
<p>“You built this,” I gestured back toward the atrium’s glow, “not to
heal the world. You built it to erase that moment. To create a world
where no one is ever truly present, so no one can ever be truly absent.
Where memory is a filtered, collective dream, so no one has to live
alone with the unforgivable specificity of their own. It’s not a Well.
It’s a tomb. You’re burying them all in it with you.”</p>
<p>He looked at me then, truly looked. The mask was gone. What remained
was ravaged, ancient. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m the one who found the frog,” I said, and the absurdity of it was
the only truth that fit. “The key was underneath. To a different
house.”</p>
<p>From the atrium, a swell of noise erupted. Not the algorithmic music,
but real, human sound—raised, querulous voices, the sound of many people
talking at once. A disturbance in the curated flow. I heard a familiar,
reedy voice holding forth about the correct way to make <em>kaya</em> in
1962. Mdm. Lim’s cavalry had arrived. The queue for the Memory Well was
now inside, and it was full of inconvenient, vibrant, unstoppable
stories.</p>
<p>The distraction was perfect.</p>
<p>Thorne heard it too. His eyes flickered toward the noise, then back
to me. The ravaged man receded; the CEO reasserted himself, but it was a
cracked facade. “You can’t stop this. The funding. The approvals. The
public want it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to stop the machine,” I said. I bent down, picked up
his remote, and handed it to him. Our fingers did not touch. “I’m trying
to stop you from living inside it. The story you buried is the only
thing that’s real about you. Everything else…” I looked past him, to the
door of the core. “It’s just noise.”</p>
<p>I turned and walked back down the corridor, toward the cacophony of
real life. I didn’t look back. I felt his gaze on me, a weight between
my shoulder blades, until I merged with the crowd.</p>
<p>The atrium was glorious chaos. A dozen aunties and uncles from
God-knows-where, dressed in their best, were holding court. They were
feeding their stories into the intake terminals with deliberate,
painstaking slowness, arguing with the prompts, correcting the AI’s
assumptions, offering tangents upon tangents. The system was glitching,
the holograms stuttering. The cream-tuniced attendants were fluttering,
helpless. The pristine narrative was breaking down under the weight of
lived experience.</p>
<p>I saw Mdm. Lim near a potted fiddle-leaf fig, sipping a glass of
water. She met my eyes and gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod.
<em>Stubbornness</em>, her look said.</p>
<p>I moved through the chaos, a still point in the turning world. The
spiritual seeking was over. I had not found peace. I had not found
truth. I had found a reflection—a man who had tried to outrun his story
by building a prison for everyone else’s. And in seeing him, I had seen
the alternative. Not to run. Not to build. But to stand in the five-foot
way, in the space for waiting, and hold the un-sanitized truth of your
own life, however it smells of wet asphalt and grief.</p>
<p>I left the atrium. The rain had stopped. The sky was the colour of a
fresh bruise, bleeding into twilight. The city gleamed, wet and new and
old all at once. I walked without destination, feeling the cut on my
ribs, a familiar companion. The cold presence in Toa Payoh was quiet
now, not gone, but sated. It had been witnessed.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed. Not Mdm. Lim. An unknown number.</p>
<p><em>The frog was never missing. You were looking in the wrong place.
The right story finds its key when it’s ready. Come to 28B. There’s
something you need to see.</em></p>
<p>I stared at the words. The address was an incantation that had,
perhaps, simply been waiting for its time. The journey was a spiral, not
a circle. I was back at the beginning, but I was not the same. I had a
weapon. I had a story. And I had, at last, a question worth asking.</p>
<p>I turned my steps toward Spottiswoode Park. The night air was cool on
my skin. Somewhere behind me, in a temple of light, a flawed god was
crumbling. Ahead of me, in a shophouse with a blue ceramic frog, a door
was finally opening. I walked toward it, the sound of my footsteps on
the damp pavement the only drum I needed. The vigil was over. The
digging was done.</p>
<p>What remained was to go home.</p>
