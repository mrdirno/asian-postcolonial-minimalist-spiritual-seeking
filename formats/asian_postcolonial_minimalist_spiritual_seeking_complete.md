## **Chapter 1**

Sunlight fell through the jalousie windows, cutting the dust into precise, geometric bars. On the floor, a single mat. A single bowl. A space so empty it hummed.


Auntie Li had said the key would be under the blue ceramic frog by the pot of stubborn ixora. She had not said what to do if the frog was gone. She had not said what to do if the rain felt like it would last for days, and the jet lag was a hollow ringing in my bones, and the address I’d memorised—28B Spottiswoode Park Road—seemed less like a location and more like a incantation that had failed to work.

I had left London seventy-two hours ago. Not left. Unmoored. There was no dramatic rupture, no fired job or broken heart. There was only a quiet, accumulating certainty, like dust on a windowsill, that the life I was building was not a life, but a very convincing replica. I worked in archival restoration at the British Library, piecing together Victorian botanical manuscripts. My hands were skilled at repairing the tears in pressed flowers, in mixing watercolours to match faded cochineal pinks. I lived in a white-painted flat in Crouch End with a philodendron I sometimes forgot to water. I had a boyfriend, Mark, who talked about ski trips and ISAs. The silence between us had grown so thick it had its own texture, like felt.

The unravelling began with a box. A donation to the archive, from the estate of a colonial administrator who had served in the Straits Settlements. Inside, among the usual ledgers and dry correspondence, was a sketchbook. It was small, bound in cracked leather the colour of old blood. The pages were not filled with official records, but with pencil drawings of trees. Not scientific renderings. These were intimate, almost restless. The frantic scribble of rain-tree roots cracking a sidewalk. The skeletal elegance of a angsana in winter, which was not winter at all, but the *shedding* season. On the last page, in a cramped, tired hand, was written: *To know a place, learn its trees. They are the true historians. They remember the soil. They remember the silence before the words.*

I touched that page with my cotton-gloved finger. The paper was soft, thirsty. I felt a jolt, clean and sharp as a paper cut. It was the first true feeling in months.

Three weeks later, I gave notice on the flat. Mark said, “Singapore? That’s random.” He did not ask to come. I sold or gave away everything that wouldn’t fit in the bruise-coloured suitcase. My mother, in our weekly call from Kuala Lumpur, was cautiously pleased. “Good. You are too pale. You need some sun, some soup.” She did not ask about the leaving, only about the arriving. That was her way.

The rain softened from a wall to a curtain. I took a breath of the thick, washed air and stepped out, the suitcase wheels clacking over the wet seams of the pavement. The shophouses were a parade of restored perfection: fresh coats of pastel paint, gleaming brass number plates, chic cafes with minimalist signage. Number 28B was not like them. Its paint was a faded ochre, peeling at the window frames like sunburnt skin. The ixora by the door was a riot of red blooms, defiantly untidy. And there, half-hidden in the damp soil, was the frog. Not blue, but a weathered turquoise, one chipped eye staring blankly upward.

The key was there, cold and solid. The lock turned with a groan.

The smell hit me first: closed-up air, lemongrass from a reed diffuser stuck in a corner, and underneath it all, the scent of old wood and mildew—the smell of a house that has been breathing slowly, on its own, for a long time. The front room was a shadowy rectangle, slatted light from the shutters painting bars on the terrazzo floor. Furniture stood under white sheets, like a gathering of quiet ghosts. A staircase, steep and dark, led upwards.

Auntie Li was my mother’s cousin’s wife. I had met her once, at a wedding when I was twelve. She was a small, sharp woman who had pinched my cheek and said, “So English already.” She had moved to Penang to care for her own mother, leaving this, her late husband’s family house, empty. “You can stay,” she’d said over the phone, her voice crackling with distance. “Keep the ghosts company. Just don’t let the termites have it.”

I pulled a sheet from the nearest shape. It was a rosewood sofa, carved with peonies. I ran a hand over the arm. The wood was cool, the grain like a frozen river. My phone buzzed in my pocket. Mark. A text: *You get in ok?*

*Yes*, I typed back. *House is old.*

Three dots appeared, then vanished. No reply came.

The silence of the house was different from the silence of my London flat. That was a hollow silence, a silence of absence. This was a *full* silence. It hummed. It held the echoes of countless monsoon rains, of family arguments in Hokkien and English, of the sizzle of woks from the kitchen at the back. I could feel it against my skin, like pressure.

I wheeled my suitcase to the foot of the stairs. It was too heavy to lift. I would have to unpack down here, carry things up in increments. The thought was exhausting. Instead, I walked through to the kitchen.

It was a time capsule. Green ceramic tiles. A squat, two-burner gas stove. A large, single-door refrigerator that probably hadn’t run in years. On a Formica table, covered in a plastic lace cloth, was a note weighed down by a jar of *kaya*.

*Ming,
Welcome. Electricity is on. Water heater switch is outside bathroom. Don’t use the tap in the backyard—pipe is broken. Market is at end of road, turn left. The tree man comes on Fridays.
– Auntie Li*

*The tree man.* I put the note down. Through the kitchen window, barred with wrought iron, I saw the backyard. It was a small square of concrete, moss staining its corners. But in the centre, growing straight through a hole in the concrete, was a tree.

It was not a big tree. Its trunk was slender, wrapped in a smooth, pale bark that looked almost silver in the wet light. Its leaves were a glossy, dark green, oval-shaped with a delicate point. It held itself with a peculiar grace, this tree growing in a cage of concrete, its branches reaching over the high walls as if searching for something it remembered. It was utterly, heartbreakingly alone.

I unlocked the back door and stepped out. The rain had stopped. The air steamed. I walked to the tree and placed my palm flat against its trunk. It was cool and damp. I half-expected a vibration, a pulse, some echo of the jolt from the sketchbook. There was only the solid, silent fact of it. A living thing in a stone yard.

A voice came from over the wall. “It’s a *Tembusu*.”

I snatched my hand back. A man’s head and shoulders appeared above the neighbouring wall. He was perhaps in his sixties, his hair short and grey, his face a landscape of gentle wrinkles. He wore a simple grey singlet.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t mean to—”

“It’s fine. It’s a good tree.” His voice was low, raspy, as if used infrequently. “Very stubborn. They paved around it, you see. Thirty years ago. They thought it would die. It just… slowed down.”

I looked up at the branches. “What’s a Tembusu?”

“A memory tree,” he said. He rested his arms on the wall. “Its wood is hard. Good for chopping blocks. Its flowers smell very strong at night. Like… regret and sugar.” He said it not poetically, but as a simple fact. “You are the niece?”

“Great-niece. Ming.”

“Ah.” He nodded. “I am Mr. Goh. Next door. Since before you were a thought.” He looked at the tree, then at my suitcase still visible through the kitchen door. “You are staying.”

“For a while.”

“Good. The house needs breathing.” He pushed himself back from the wall. “The rain will come again. Close your windows on the west side.”

His head disappeared. I was alone again with the tree. *A memory tree.* I looked at its leaves, still dripping diamonds onto the concrete. I thought of the sketchbook in the archive, the frantic roots, the skeletal branches. *They remember the soil.*

I went inside, the damp already settling on my skin. Upstairs, I found a bedroom with a wrought-iron bedframe and a thin mattress. The single window looked out over a narrow alley to the back of another row of shophouses. I opened it, and the sound of the city rushed in—the distant groan of traffic, the clatter of a food cart, a snippet of a radio song in Mandarin. It was not the quiet hum of my Crouch End street. This was a layered, living sound.

I lay down on the bare mattress, the iron pressing through into my back. The jet lag was a tide now, pulling me under. I thought of Mark, of his unanswered text. I thought of the meticulous, colour-coded spreadsheet I’d made for this move, now useless in my phone. I thought of the Tembusu, its roots pushing patiently against the concrete, its memory of forest soil deep below the pipes and cables and foundations.

Sleep came, not as a rest, but as a sinking. I dreamed not of trees, but of paper. I was in the archive, but the sketchbook was empty. I was frantically mixing paints, trying to match a colour I could no longer see. A colour between ochre and turquoise, between regret and sugar. My brush hovered over the page, but I had forgotten the shape of the leaf.

I woke in the deep blue hour before dawn. The house was dark. The full silence was back. And from the backyard, carried on a faint, cool breeze through the window, came a scent. Cloying, sweet, piercingly strong. It filled the room, this scent of night flowers.

I got up and went to the window. I couldn’t see the tree from here, but I could smell it. *Like regret and sugar.*

Mr. Goh was right. The Tembusu was flowering.

Downstairs, in the ghost-filled living room, I opened my suitcase. I took out the few clothes, the toiletries, the small pouch of restoration tools I couldn’t leave behind. At the very bottom, wrapped in a piece of soft flannel, was the thing I had stolen.

It was not the sketchbook. That was still in the archive, catalogued and safe. It was a single, loose page. The one with the sentence. *To know a place, learn its trees.*

I had not planned to take it. On my last day, as I was cleaning out my locker, I had slipped it from its Mylar sleeve. A tremor went through me, a thief’s thrill that was also a ache. It was the only thing I took that wasn’t mine.

I unfolded it now on the rosewood sofa. In the dim light, the pencil lines were faint ghosts. I traced the words with my finger, not the gloved, archival finger, but my own bare skin.

The first bird of dawn called, a sharp, clear note that cut through the scent of the flowers. A motorbike coughed to life somewhere. The city was waking up.

I folded the page and put it in the pocket of my trousers. I walked to the kitchen, filled a chipped ceramic cup with water from the tap, and drank. The water tasted of chlorine and old pipes.

Then I went to the back door, opened it, and stood on the concrete, facing the Tembusu. The sky was lightening to a mother-of-pearl grey. The flowers were small, creamy clusters, almost invisible against the leaves, but their perfume owned the air.

“Okay,” I said to the tree, to the house, to the silence. My voice sounded strange here, too crisp, too English. I tried again, softer. “Okay.”

I was here.

# Chapter 2

## **Chapter 2**

The market at the end of the road was not a place you found. It was a place that found you, pulling you in by a thousand threads of smell and sound. It began with the metallic shriek of a grinder sharpening knives, a spark-showering aria that cut through the humid morning. Then the smells: overripe jackfruit, the clean sting of chopped ginger, the pungent, life-affirming funk of dried shrimp and salted fish. Stalls spilled onto the five-foot way, a taxonomy of necessity: pyramids of spiky durians next to meticulous stacks of folded *kangkung*, blue plastic tubs of live, flipping fish, their mouths gasping in slow motion.

I moved through the current, a stone in a stream. My London clothes—linen trousers, a plain cotton t-shirt—felt like a costume. The aunties in their floral *samfu* and slip-on sandals assessed me with glances that were neither friendly nor hostile, but purely diagnostic. *Not local. Not tourist. What is she?*

I had come for practical things: eggs, rice, coffee. But the sheer specificity of everything was paralyzing. What kind of rice? There were sacks labelled “Jasmine,” “Basmati,” “Thai Hom Mali,” “Sushi,” and one simply called “Old Uncle’s Preferred.” The eggs came in trays of ten, twenty, or thirty, brown or white, some stamped with red Chinese characters promising mountain-fed hens. I stood, adrift.

“You block the way.”

The voice was matter-of-fact. I turned. An elderly woman sat on a stool behind a mountain of bitter melons. Her face was a walnut shell of wrinkles, her eyes bright black buttons. She wore a striped apron.

“Sorry,” I mumbled, stepping aside.

“First time.” It wasn’t a question. She picked up a melon, her knotted fingers probing its warty skin. “You live in Li’s house.”

News travelled in capillaries here, not wires. “Yes.”

“Hmph. That house is too quiet.” She put the melon down, selected another. “You want bitter melon?”

“I… don’t know how to cook it.”

She looked at me as if I’d said I didn’t know how to breathe. “You learn. Good for cooling the blood. Too much city heat makes people stupid.” She bagged two melons, thin and green as jealousy, and thrust them at me. “Five dollars.”

I fumbled for my wallet. As I handed her the note, she said, “The tree man was here yesterday. For Li. He said the Tembusu has a hollow. You tell Li.”

“The tree man?”

“Friday,” she said, as if explaining to a child. “Today is Friday. He comes. You didn’t see the card?”

I hadn’t. I took the bag, the melons bumping against my leg. “Thank you.”

“Eat the melon with black beans. And garlic. Not too much salt.” She waved me away, her attention already on the next customer.

I bought rice (“Old Uncle’s Preferred”), eggs (brown, ten), and a small bag of coffee grounds that smelled of earth and smoke. As I turned to leave, I saw a card taped to the side of a drinks stall, fluttering in the fan’s breeze. It was simple, white, the text in clean black type:

**ARBOR CULTURE**
*Tree Care | Consultation | Heritage Specimens*
*K. S. Lim*
*A phone number.*

I memorised the number. *Arbor Culture.* Not “Tree Cutting” or “Garden Services.” *Culture.* It implied a relationship.

Back at 28B, the morning light had climbed the walls, baking the damp from the terrazzo. The house felt different in the day—less a repository of ghosts, more a sleepy animal. I put the groceries on the Formica table and saw a new note next to the *kaya* jar.

*Ming,
The tree man, Mr. Lim, came. He says the Tembusu has a hollow at the base, from the old paving. He will come back to talk. Be nice to him. He knows more about roots than people.
– A. Li*

*Be nice to him.* As if I would be otherwise. I put the bitter melons in the empty refrigerator, which hummed to life with a startling, vibrating rattle. I made coffee with a small pot I found in a cupboard, its enamel chipped to reveal black iron beneath. It tasted brutal and necessary.

The hollow. I went to the backyard. In the stark daylight, the tree’s situation seemed more brutal, more miraculous. The concrete formed a perfect, tight seal around the base of the trunk, like a manacle. I crouched, running my fingers over the junction where bark met stone. On the side facing the kitchen wall, hidden from casual view, was a dark opening, about the size of my fist. A cavity. Inside, it was shadowy, a void. I thought of decay, of weakness. A hollow tree could fall.

“It’s not a sickness.”

I started, nearly losing my balance. A man stood in the open gateway to the alley. I hadn’t heard the gate open. He was tall, lean, dressed in faded olive-green work trousers and a grey t-shirt. He looked to be in his late forties, his face all angles—sharp cheekbones, a strong jaw softened by a day’s stubble. His hair was black, threaded with silver, cut short. But it was his hands I noticed first. They were large, the fingers long, the skin etched with a fine lattice of scars and stains that no soap would ever remove. They hung at his sides, still, as if accustomed to waiting.

“Mr. Lim?”

He gave a slight nod. “Kai.” His eyes were on the tree, not on me. They were a dark brown, almost black, and they moved over the Tembusu with a focus that felt physical, like a touch. “The hollow. It’s not a disease. It’s a negotiation.”

“A negotiation?”

“With the concrete.” He walked into the yard, his movements quiet, deliberate. He didn’t look at me as he spoke; his dialogue was with the tree. “When they paved, they wounded it. The tree sealed off the damaged wood. Created a boundary. The hollow is the space it surrendered, to save the rest.” He finally glanced at me. “A retreat is not a defeat. It’s a strategy for survival.”

His voice was calm, low. It held no salesman’s pitch, no false concern. It stated facts as the tree might state them, if it could speak.

“Will it fall?” I asked.

“Not because of this.” He crouched where I had crouched, his back to me. He did not touch the tree immediately. He looked. He breathed. Then he placed his palm flat against the bark, beside the hollow, and closed his eyes for a three-count. When he opened them, he said, “The roots are deep. They found the old soil, below the pipes. It’s stable. But the hollow can hold water. Breed insects. It needs to breathe.” He stood, brushing dust from his knees. “I can clean it. Treat it. But it is part of the tree’s story now. You don’t erase a story. You just make sure it doesn’t end the book.”

I stared at him. This was not how arborists spoke in documentaries. “Auntie Li said you’d come to talk.”

“I am talking.” A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. It was gone quickly. “You are Ming. From London.”

“Yes.”

“You restore paper.”

This stopped me. “How did you know that?”

“Auntie Li. She told my mother, who goes to the same temple. Information travels.” He looked around the yard, at the moss, the high walls. “Paper and trees. Not so different. Both hold memory. Both are fragile.”

The coincidence, if it was one, felt like a hook in my chest. “I saw a sketchbook. Of trees. Here. In Singapore. It’s why I came.”

He was silent for a moment, studying me. The diagnostic look of the market aunties, but deeper, quieter. “Many people come to Singapore for many reasons. Money. Food. Family. Not for trees in a book.” He didn’t say it judgmentally. “What will you do here?”

The question, so simple, laid bare the vast blankness of my plan. “I… don’t know yet. Stay. Look.”

He nodded, as if “look” was a sufficient answer. “The treatment for the hollow. It is not expensive, but it is not free. You need to ask Auntie Li.”

“I’ll pay for it,” I heard myself say. I had savings, a buffer. This felt important. Not a duty, but a first step.

He considered this. “Okay. I can do it next week. Wednesday morning. Early, before the sun is on this wall.” He took a small, worn notebook from his back pocket, wrote something, tore out the page. It was a figure, neat and precise. “This is the cost. You can change your mind.” He handed it to me. Our fingers did not touch.

“Thank you, Mr. Lim.”

“Kai,” he corrected. He gave the Tembusu one last look. “The flowers will fade in a week. The scent will go. But the tree remains.” He turned and left through the alley gate, closing it softly behind him.

I stood in the yard, the quote on the paper in my pocket. *To know a place, learn its trees.* Kai Lim knew trees. He spoke of hollows as negotiations, of roots finding old soil. He had hands that read bark like braille.

The house felt different when I went back inside. It was no longer just a shell I occupied. It was a node in a network—connected to the bitter melon seller, to Auntie Li’s temple gossip, to a tree man who saw stories in wood. I was the foreign element, the unknown variable.

I spent the afternoon uncovering the house. I took the sheets off the furniture. A solid dining table. Four chairs with cane seats. A sideboard that held a dusty set of ceramic bowls. Upstairs, in a small study, I found a bookshelf. Most of the books were in Chinese, leather-bound classics. But on the bottom shelf was a stack of old *National Geographic* magazines from the 1970s, and a single, thin volume in English: *Common Trees of Singapore and Malaya.* Its spine was cracked, its pages foxed with brown spots.

I sat on the floor and opened it. It was a field guide, with line drawings and dry descriptions. I flipped until I found it: *Fagraea fragrans. Tembusu. A hardy evergreen… timber is hard and durable… flowers are creamy white, strongly fragrant at night.*

I read the entry twice. It told me nothing of negotiations or memory. It was a skeleton. Kai Lim had offered the flesh.

My phone buzzed. My mother. I answered.

“Ming. You are alive.” Her voice was crisp, long-distance. “The house is okay? Not too dirty?”

“It’s fine, Ma. A bit old.”

“Old is good. Solid. You eat? You look thin on the video call last time.”

“I just went to the market.”

“Good. Listen.” Her tone shifted, into the realm of practical announcements. “Auntie Li says you met the tree man. Lim. His family is good people. From Johor. His father was a gardener for the British, then for the government. He knows his business. You be respectful.”

“I was, Ma.”

“Good. Also, Mark called me.”

The sentence landed like a dropped dish. “What? Why?”

“He is worried. He says you are not answering his texts properly. He thinks you are… having a crisis.” She said the word as if it were a mild, embarrassing rash.

“I’m not having a crisis. I’m just… here.”

“Mm.” It was a sound of profound skepticism. “To be alone in an old house is not ‘just here,’ Ming. It is a choice. He is a good boy, Mark. Steady. But maybe not for you. A crisis is not always a bad thing. Sometimes it is just a turning.”

I was speechless. My mother, the pragmatist, the soup-maker, was offering romantic philosophy.

“Don’t let the tree man charge you too much,” she said, reverting to type. “And drink more water. The heat there steals your moisture from the inside.”

We hung up. I leaned against the bookshelf. Mark had called my mother. It was a move of such staggering, clueless intimacy that I couldn’t decide if I was angry or sad. He was trying to fix me, from seven thousand miles away, using the wrong tools. He was trying to repair a tear with the wrong shade of paint.

The blue hour descended again. I made rice, scrambling an egg with a dash of soy sauce. I attempted the bitter melon, slicing it open to reveal its startling, white pith and seeds. I scooped them out, sliced the green flesh, and fried it with black beans and garlic, as instructed. It was appallingly bitter, a taste that shocked my tongue and then, slowly, revealed a clean, mineral aftertaste. *Good for cooling the blood.*

I ate on the steps of the back door, watching the Tembusu become a silhouette against the indigo sky. The cloying scent of the flowers was beginning to rise again. *Regret and sugar.*

I thought of Kai Lim’s hands. I thought of the hollow—a negotiation, a surrendered space. I thought of my life in London, the neat, colour-coded replica. Had I created a hollow there? Sealed off a damaged part to save the rest? What had I surrendered?

The sketchbook page in my pocket seemed to pulse with a quiet heat. I had come looking for the trees from the drawings. But the first tree I’d met had a story no sketch could capture—a story of concrete and resilience, of hollows and deep, seeking roots. And the man who cared for it spoke of it not as a problem to be solved, but as a history to be respected.

A gecko chirped from the kitchen wall. *Chik-chik-chik.* A sound as old as the tropics.

I finished the bitter melon, every bite. The bitterness was a truth I had to swallow. I washed the plate, the cold water shocking my wrists.

Upstairs, in the iron bed, I listened. The city’s night sounds were a different symphony. Fewer engines, more insects. The occasional shout from a nearby supper club. The relentless, rhythmic chirping of the geckos.

I did not dream of paper. I dreamed of roots. A slow, patient, dark pushing through resistant earth. A seeking for the old soil, the true soil, far beneath the paved world.

# Chapter 3

## **Chapter 3**

Wednesday arrived on a tide of heat. By 7 a.m., the sun was a white coin in a bleached sky, and the air in the backyard was already thick, pressing down on the concrete and the lone tree. I was dressed, coffee drunk, a nervous energy making my hands feel clumsy. I kept checking the alley gate.

At five minutes past seven, it opened. Kai Lim entered, followed by a younger man—maybe early twenties—pushing a handcart laden with tools, buckets, and a small metal tank. The young man had Kai’s sharp cheekbones but a softer expression, and his hair was dyed a faint, reddish brown at the tips.

“This is my nephew, Ah Boon,” Kai said. His greeting was a nod. He wore the same work trousers, a fresh grey t-shirt. His eyes went immediately to the Tembusu, assessing the light on its trunk. “We’ll start.”

There was no small talk. Ah Boon unloaded the cart with efficient, quiet movements. He set up a tripod with a professional-looking camera, then began arranging tools on a clean tarp: curved scrapers, wire brushes, a small handsaw, bottles of solutions, a syringe-like injector. It looked less like construction and more like surgery.

Kai approached the tree. He did the same thing as before: a moment of stillness, a palm placed on the bark. Then he took a piece of chalk from his pocket and drew a light, square outline around the hollow. “We open this a little. Clean. No more than necessary.” He spoke to Ah Boon, but it was for my benefit too. “The tree has already built its barrier. We are just… tidying the edges.”

He took a slender scraper and began, with infinite care, to remove the crumbling, rotten wood from the lip of the hollow. The sound was a soft, dry scratching. Fragments of wood, dark and damp, fell onto the tarp below. Ah Boon moved the camera, taking close-up pictures from different angles.

“Documentation,” Kai said, seeing my look. “For the tree’s history. Before, during, after.”

I sat on the back step, watching. It was intensely intimate. This wasn’t pruning or watering; this was interacting with a wound, with the tree’s private struggle. Kai’s hands were mesmerizing. They were never harsh, never hurried. The scraper was an extension of his finger, probing, feeling, discerning between what was dead and what was merely sleeping. His concentration was absolute. The noisy city, the heat, my presence—all seemed to fall away from the sphere of his focus.

After an hour, the hollow was slightly larger, but its edges were clean, showing smooth, healthy wood where the tree had compartmentalized the damage. Inside, the cavity was a dark, neat chamber.

“See here,” Kai said, pointing with the tip of the scraper. A line, like a seam in the wood, ran vertically inside the hollow. “This is the boundary wall. The tree made this. On this side,” he tapped outside the seam, “is living tissue. On that side,” he gestured into the darkness, “is what it sacrificed. A life for a life.”

He mixed a solution in a small bucket, a clear liquid with a sharp, clean smell like pine and alcohol. With a brush, he painted the entire interior of the cavity. “This helps. Prevents rot. Encourages the bark to callus over, in time.” His movements were methodical, a priest anointing an altar.

Finally, he took the syringe-like tool. It was filled with a foam that expanded as he injected it gently into the deepest part of the hollow, near the base. “This fills the space, but it’s breathable. It supports, but doesn’t strangle. And it’s soft. If the tree wants to grow into it, it can.”

When he finished, he stepped back. The hollow was now a clean, treated wound, partly filled with pale foam. It looked cared for, not cured. There was no pretending it wasn’t there.

Ah Boon took more photographs. Kai cleaned his tools meticulously, wiping each one with a rag before placing it back on the tarp. The silence was companionable, filled with the completion of a precise task.

“Will it flower again?” I asked. My voice sounded too loud.

Kai looked at the canopy. “Yes. Maybe not as much this season. It spent energy on this.” He gestured to the hollow. “But next year. It is a stubborn tree.”

Ah Boon began packing the cart. Kai came over to the steps, accepting the glass of water I offered. He drank it all in one long pull, his throat working.

“Thank you,” I said. “For showing me. For explaining.”

“Understanding is part of the care.” He handed the glass back. “You are not like Auntie Li. She would have just said ‘fix it and send the bill.’”

“I’m not from here.”

“I know.” He looked at me directly then, and his dark eyes held a quiet curiosity. “The sketchbook you saw. What trees were in it?”

The question caught me off guard. I fumbled for description. “Rain trees. Angsana. A fig, I think, with aerial roots. They weren’t… calm drawings. They were urgent.”

He nodded slowly. “The artist saw the tension. Most people see the green. They don’t see the fight.” He paused. “There is a rain tree. In the Botanic Gardens. Near Swan Lake. It is… significant. It was planted when the gardens were first made. It has seen everything.” He said it not as a tour guide fact, but as a piece of intelligence. “If you are looking for trees with stories, start there.”

He gave a brief instruction to Ah Boon in rapid Hokkien, then turned back to me. “The bill. I will leave it with the bitter melon auntie. She is my wife’s mother.”

The connection snapped into place. The market network. “Oh.”

A faint smile. “Small island.” He gathered the tarp, folding it with sharp, precise folds. “The tree will be tired. Don’t water it today. Let it rest.”

And with that, they were gone, the cart wheels rumbling softly down the alley. The backyard was silent again, but changed. The Tembusu stood with its clean, open wound. The air still held the astringent scent of the treatment solution, overlying the fading sweetness of the flowers.

I felt charged, restless. The Botanic Gardens. The rain tree. It was a destination, a purpose. I grabbed my bag, my wide-brimmed hat, and left the house.

The Botanic Gardens were a shock of curated green. After the tight, vertical lines of the shophouses and the concrete yard, the sprawl of lawn, the towering canopy, the sheer *volume* of life was overwhelming. I followed the signs to Swan Lake, a placid sheet of water with an island of palms in its centre. And there, on a gentle slope overlooking the water, was the rain tree.

It was a giant. Its canopy spread like a vast, green thunderhead, casting a pool of deep, cool shade that must have been fifty metres across. Its trunk was massive, buttressed with great, sinuous roots that flowed out of the ground like molten rock frozen in mid-pour. It was the opposite of the confined Tembusu. This was a tree of empire, of space, of unquestioned belonging.

I sat on a bench in its shade. The temperature dropped noticeably. The frantic drawings in the sketchbook came back to me—the scribbled roots, the explosive energy. Seeing this tree, I understood the impulse. This was not a passive thing. It was a conquest of light and space.

“Magnificent, isn’t it?”

An elderly man sat down on the far end of the bench. He was European, white-haired, dressed in a crisp, short-sleeved shirt and trousers. He held a walking stick with a silver handle.

“Yes,” I said.

“Planted in 1879,” he said, his accent British, old-school. “By the Director, Henry Murton. A gift from the Calcutta Botanic Gardens.” He recited it like a well-loved poem. “It has witnessed the whole parade. Colonial officials, Japanese occupation, independence, tourists with selfie sticks.” He chuckled. “A silent witness. The best kind.”

I looked at the tree’s vast, wrinkled bark. A silent witness. But Kai Lim would say it was more. It was a living participant, fighting for light, shedding leaves, drawing water, writing its history in rings.

“Do you come here often?” I asked.

“Every day since I retired. Twenty years ago.” He smiled. “My wife is buried here. In the cemetery on the other side of the park. I talk to her, then I talk to the tree. The tree is often more listening.” He leaned on his stick. “You are new.”

“Is it that obvious?”

“You are looking at the tree like it’s about to

## **Chapter 4**

The rain in Singapore is a solid thing, but the silence that followed the old man’s unfinished sentence was its own kind of weather. It hung between us on the bench, thick and expectant. *You are looking at the tree like it’s about to…* To speak? To move? To reveal a secret written in the pattern of its leaves? He never finished. A mynah bird landed on the path with a sharp, scolding cry, and he simply nodded, as if the bird had completed his thought for him. He rose, leaning on his silver-handled stick, and offered a vague, polite smile that belonged to another century. “Enjoy the shade,” he said, and walked away, a slow, deliberate figure dissolving into the green haze of the park.

I was left with the giant. Its roots were like the limbs of something submerged, heaving themselves out of the earth for a single, held breath. A silent witness, he’d called it. But the tree in my sketchbook, Kai Lim’s tree, was screaming. I felt the dissonance like a pressure in my inner ear. This quiet, monumental presence, and the frantic, spiritual seeking it had ignited in a stranger decades ago, did not align. There was a missing step. A catalyst.

Auntie Li, when I’d paid the rent, had mentioned a name, dropped it like a spent match. “You ask about trees, you find Thorne. Crazy *ang moh* in a shophouse near Sultan Mosque. He knows roots.” She’d waved a dismissive hand. “But his mind is… tangled.”

I found the shophouse. It was tucked in a row of pastel buildings, its five-foot way cluttered not with café tables but with terracotta pots holding stunted, twisted bonsai. Their trunks were knotted, their canopies tortured into miniature clouds. They were trees under duress. The door was a heavy thing of dark, varnished wood, set with a pane of frosted glass. No blue ceramic frog. I knocked.

The sound was swallowed by the ambient hum of the lane—the distant call to prayer, the sizzle of a wok. I was about to turn when the door opened a crack, revealing a slice of a face: pale, blue-eyed, framed by unkempt grey hair. The eyes were not old. They were alarmingly clear, the blue of a gas flame.

“You’re not the delivery,” the man said. His voice was dry, textured like sandstone.

“Auntie Li sent me. I’m Leo. From the Tembusu shophouse.”

The eyes assessed me, moving from my face to the bag on my shoulder where the sketchbook was stored. “Li.” He said the name as if tasting something sour. “She thinks I need a keeper. Or you do.” He opened the door wider. “Come in. The street has ears.”

The interior was not a home. It was a workshop, a cave, a brain made physical. The air was cool and smelled of ozone, soldering iron, and the damp, mineral scent of wet clay. The walls, where visible between shelves, were lined with banks of humming electronics—rack-mounted servers with flickering LEDs, oscilloscopes painting green sine waves on dark screens. But woven through this nest of tech were organic things: specimens of polished wood cross-sections, their rings like topographic maps; fossils of fern and leaf pressed between glass; and everywhere, more bonsai, their tiny forms perched on monitors and stacks of books.

In the centre of the room stood a long, steel table. And on it, under a dome of clear acrylic, was the artifact.

It was both less and more than I’d imagined. Not a jewel, but a dull, greyish orb about the size of a mango, its surface matte and non-reflective. It seemed to drink the light. Around it, on the steel, was a careful arrangement of objects: a piece of raw crystal, a spool of copper wire, a fresh frangipani blossom already browning at the edges, and a small, bowl-shaped sensor that glowed with a soft, amber pulse.

“You found the sketchbook,” Thorne said. It wasn’t a question. He moved to the table, his gait stiff. He wore faded cargo trousers and a shirt that had once been white. “Kai Lim was a friend. A brilliant, doomed friend. He didn’t just draw trees. He listened to them.”

“He wrote about a key,” I said, my voice low in the sanctum-like quiet. “A spiritual key.”

Thorne’s lips twitched. Not a smile. A spasm of old pain. “A key implies a lock. A door. He was a romantic. I am a mechanic.” He tapped the acrylic dome. “This is not a spiritual key. It is a temporal anchor. A battery. A recording device. The civilization that made it… they didn’t build cities. They grew them. They didn’t write history. They *imbued* it, into living systems. They believed time was not a river, but a tree. A single, branching reality. This…”

He lifted the dome. The air in the room seemed to tighten, to hum at a frequency just below hearing. The amber pulse from the sensor bowl quickened.

“This is a seed from that tree. A seed that records the state of the world—the light, the magnetic fields, the quantum noise, the growth patterns of the forest around it. It doesn’t store data. It stores *echoes*. Kai called it the ‘Whispering Pod.’ He believed the great trees—the Tembusu, the Rain Tree—were like… antennas. They could tune into these echoes. He was trying to listen.”

He reached out, not touching the orb, but moving his hand in a slow arc above it. The matte surface shimmered. From its core, light emerged—not a beam, but a coalescence, like dust motes dancing in a sunbeam. It formed shapes above the orb: three-dimensional, holographic symbols that rotated slowly. They looked like a hybrid of organic tendrils and crystalline geometry. One pulsed a soft, warning red.

“This,” Thorne said, pointing to the red symbol, “is a decay marker. The echo is unstable. It was never meant to be dormant this long. Interacting with it raw, as Kai tried to do… it’s like putting your ear to a seashell that contains the roar of the primordial ocean. It can overwrite you. Dissolve the boundary between now and then.”

He looked at me, his gas-flame eyes burning. “Kai didn’t go mad because he was seeking spirits. He went mad because he opened a door in his mind and a thousand years of compressed, living memory tried to flood in. He was a sensitive. An antenna himself. He last came here, raving about ‘the first map’ being in the roots of the Rain Tree. Then he vanished.”

The pieces shifted, locking into a new, terrifying configuration. The frantic sketches were not the cause of his search; they were the symptom. The artifact was the cause. And Kai Lim had left a trail.

“Why show me this?” I asked.

“Because you’re here,” Thorne said simply. “And because the echo has become active in the last 48 hours. It started when you arrived. Coincidence is a story we tell when we don’t know the plot. You are now part of the system. You need to understand the rules before it reads *you*.”

He spent the next two hours teaching me. It was not a lesson in mysticism, but in a brutal, alien physics. The holographic symbols were an interface. The tendril-glyphs represented biological stability; the geometric ones, temporal coordinates. The orb responded to proximity, to bio-electric fields, to intention. He made me sit before it, hands flat on the steel table, and breathe slowly.

“Don’t reach for it,” he instructed, his voice a calm monotone. “That’s what Kai did. He tried to *grasp* the memory. You must let it flow. Be the bench under the rain tree. Be the five-foot way. A space for waiting.”

I tried. The orb’s presence was a weight on my senses. The holographic symbols shifted as my breathing changed. A new glyph, like a spiralling fern frond, glowed green. Thorne nodded. “Recognition. It sees you as part of the local biome now. A neutral element.”

It was exhausting. The effort of being passive, of holding my own consciousness like a wide, shallow bowl, left me drained. I was about to ask for water when the entire room flickered.

The holograms died. The server LEDs blinked out. For three heartbeats, we were in utter black silence, the kind that exists only before the world begins. Then the emergency lights on the power strips flicked on, casting monstrous shadows from the bonsai.

Thorne was already moving, his stiffness gone. “They’re here.” He slammed the acrylic dome over the orb and snatched it from its cradle. “The Chronos Guard. They think it’s a weapon. A key to controlling the branch-points of time. They want to prune the tree to their liking.”

“Who are they?” I hissed, grabbing my bag.

“Academics gone feral. Intelligence agencies. Cultists. A committee of the damned.” He threw a small, hard drive into my hands. “Everything. Kai’s notes, my analyses. The coordinates he deciphered for the first map.” He shoved me towards a back door I hadn’t seen, concealed by a drape of printed circuit boards. “Go to the Rain Tree. At the base of the largest eastern root. There’s a hollow. Look with the orb. Not your eyes.”

The front door exploded inward. Not with fire, but with a percussive *thump* that felt wrong—a sound that suppressed other sound. Two figures entered, silhouetted against the lane’s light. They wore dark, non-reflective suits and smooth helmets with no visible seams. They moved with a terrible, fluid synchronicity.

Thorne didn’t hesitate. He threw a handful of metallic powder from his workbench into the air. As the lead agent raised a device that looked like a streamlined hairdryer, Thorne touched a spark from a modified lighter to the cloud.

The world turned white and silent. Not a bang, but a flash of actinic light that etched everything in negative. A photonic charge. I was blind. I felt Thorne’s hand on my back, shoving me through the curtain of circuits.

I stumbled into a narrow, wet alley. The sound rushed back in—the distant traffic, my own ragged breath. Thorne followed, clutching the orb under his arm. “This way.”

We ran. The alley twisted behind rows of shophouses, a secret vein of the city. My vision returned in blotches of colour. Behind us, I heard the clean, efficient sound of pursuit—soft-soled boots on wet asphalt.

We burst onto a slightly larger street. A delivery tricycle was parked outside a closed tailor shop. Thorne ducked behind it, pulling me down. He was breathing in short, pained gasps. In the dim light, I saw the dark, spreading stain on his side. A flechette, or some silent projectile, had found him in the flash.

“Listen,” he wheezed, pressing the cold acrylic dome into my hands. The orb within felt warmer than it should. “They want a weapon. Kai wanted enlightenment. Both are wrong. It’s a *record*. The last testament of a world that chose to become one with its own timeline. The map… it’s not to a place. It’s to a state. A moment of perfect synchronization. Kai called it ‘The Canopy.’ Where all branches are visible.”

He coughed, a wet, hollow sound. “You have to get there. Not for power. For… for the witness. A silent witness is the best kind, the old man said, yes? But a *recording* witness… that is something else. That is a duty.”

The footsteps were close, methodical, splitting up to flank the alley mouth.

“Go,” Thorne said, his voice firming with a final reserve of strength. “To the tree. Let it see you. Then follow the echo.”

He pushed me away, towards a connecting alley. Then he stood up. He did not run. He turned to face the mouth of our hiding place, holding up his empty hands. A decoy. A sacrifice to the timeline.

I ran.

I didn’t look back. I heard a soft *phut* sound, and a grunt. No cry. Just the impact of a body on the ground. The sound of a life of tangled, brilliant thought meeting a very clean, very simple end.

The rain began again. Not a solid wall, but a steady, weeping drizzle. It washed over me as I ran through the back-lanes of Kampong Glam, the orb held tight to my chest. It was not a bruise-coloured suitcase. It was a darker, heavier heart, containing a world’s whisper.

I made it to the Botanic Gardens as the first grey light of dawn diluted the night. The gates were open for the early walkers. I moved like a ghost past the symphony stage, past the bandstand, towards the lake. The rain had thinned to a mist. The world was monochrome.

The Rain Tree emerged from the haze, more vast and more silent than ever. A giant holding its breath. The grass was soaking. I fell to my knees at the base of the largest eastern root, where it flowed out from the trunk like the limb of a leviathan. There was a hollow, dark with damp and leaf-litter.

My hands were shaking. I placed the acrylic dome on the wet grass and lifted the orb out. It was hot now, almost uncomfortably so. I held it before the hollow, as Thorne had taught me. Not reaching. Being a space for waiting.

The orb shimmered. The holographic light spilled forth, not in symbols this time, but in a cascade of emerald and gold particles. They flowed into the hollow, illuminating not an empty space, but a pattern. Carved into the very wood of the living root, hidden by moss and time, was a perfect, intricate circle filled with the same hybrid glyphs—tendril and geometry.

The orb’s light mapped onto the carving. It activated.

The hollow did not open. The root did not move. But the *air* within the carved circle deepened, darkened. It became a well, a tunnel. And at its end, not a place, but a sensation: a profound, resonant hum, the sound of deep earth and vast, patient growth. A scent of loam and ozone and something like old, polished stone flooded out. It was the echo, not of a memory, but of a *direction*.

The first map was not on paper. It was a door in the roots of a witness tree.

A twig snapped behind me. I turned, clutching the orb to my chest.

A woman stood ten feet away. She was dressed in the practical clothes of a morning jogger, but her posture was all wrong—too still, too balanced. Her eyes were on the orb, then on the still-glowing hollow in the root. She did not look surprised. She looked like she had arrived at an appointment.

“He showed you, then,” she said. Her voice was calm, Singaporean, with no trace of exertion. “Dr. Thorne. Where is he?”

I said nothing. The glow from the root was fading. The connection was breaking.

“It doesn’t matter,” she said, taking a slow step forward. She held no weapon. She didn’t need one. Her certainty was a weapon. “The Chronos Guard appreciates his life’s work. And yours, Mr. Tan. You’ve saved us a great deal of time. Now, let’s discuss the next branch.”

She smiled. It was a professional, empty thing.

And the rain tree, the silent witness, its leaves heavy with morning wet, began to drip, a slow, steady percussion on the earth below.

# Chapter 5

## **Chapter 5**

The mountains of central Vietnam were a different kind of rain. It was a mist that lived in the air, a permanent exhalation of the jungle that coated the skin and seeped into the seams of clothing. It turned the world into a spectrum of green and grey, where the calls of unseen birds were muffled and the ground was a soft, treacherous sponge. After the hard angles and drumming downpours of Singapore, this felt less like weather and more like a state of being. A waiting, but without the cover of a five-foot way.

I had used Thorne’s resources, a series of encrypted transfers and a name whispered over a secure line, to get here. A man with a face like weathered teak and a jeep that smelled of diesel and damp chicken feathers had left me at the end of a track that dissolved into ferns. He had pointed a gnarled finger uphill, into the cloud, and said nothing. The journey was a blur of airports and hushed conversations, a ghost itinerary. I was a parcel being forwarded, postage due.

My suitcase was gone, replaced by a worn canvas pack Thorne had left in a locker at Changi. In it: topographic maps, a water filter, a high-grade headlamp, a multi-tool, and packets of a nutritional paste that tasted of peanuts and regret. And the orb, wrapped in a square of raw silk, nestled at the centre. It was quiet now. The hollow in the rain tree had closed, its light extinguished. But the map it had revealed was etched behind my eyes: a sequence of glyphs that correlated not to a place on any modern map, but to a feeling—a specific convergence of rock, water, and magnetic anomaly. The first branch.

The climb was not a climb in the heroic sense. It was a slow, stubborn seep upwards. The path was a suggestion made by boar and boot, vanishing for stretches under curtains of liana and sudden, slick inclines. The air grew thinner, cooler, but never dry. My world contracted to the next handhold, the next semi-solid patch of ground. The jungle was a cathedral of dripping silence, a green vault where time pooled. I was not an explorer. I was an intruder, a small, damp mammal moving through the lungs of something vast and indifferent.

I stopped when the light began to leach from the mist, not into darkness, but into a deeper, more profound grey. I made camp on a shelf of rock, ate a paste-smeared cracker, and watched the cloud swallow the valley below. The silence was not empty. It was layered: the drip from a thousand leaves, the rustle of something in the canopy, the low, sub-auditory hum of my own blood. I took out the orb. It was cool, inert. I held it in my palm, not reaching, as Thorne had said. Being a space.

For a long time, nothing. Then, a faint, internal warmth, like a stone that has held the sun. A single glyph on its surface—the one that looked like a root meeting a vein of quartz—glowed a soft, mossy green. It pulsed, slow and patient, in time with my heartbeat. A compass, not for north, but for resonance.

The next day, I followed that pulse. It led me off the animal trail, into a choked ravine where a stream muttered over black rocks. The glyph’s glow intensified. I waded upstream, the cold water biting through my boots, the mist coiling on the surface like smoke. The ravine walls tightened. The sound of the water changed, deepening from a chatter to a low, resonant groan. The air grew thick with the smell of wet stone and something else—ozone, the sharp, clean scent after lightning.

The ravine ended in a curtain of waterfall, not tall but wide, pouring over a lip of basalt into a frothing pool. The orb was hot in my hand now, the glyph burning a steady, urgent green. This was the place. But there was no door, no arch, no carved entrance. Just water and rock.

I stood there, the spray coating me, feeling the fool. The woman from the park, the one from the Chronos Guard with her professional smile, would have had scanners, tools, a team to divert the water. I had a warm rock and a backpack.

*Not reaching. Being a space.*

I found a relatively dry niche under an overhang, sat on the cold stone, and waited. I watched the waterfall. I watched the patterns in the mist. I let the percussion of the water fill the hollow places in my mind. Hours may have passed. The light did not change.

And then I saw it. It wasn’t a shape, but a rhythm. The waterfall fell in a consistent, heavy sheet, but in one spot, about chest-high, there was a subtle, regular shudder—a brief, translucent thinning in the cascade every seven seconds. A syncopation in the hydrography. A door that was not a door, but a hesitation.

I didn’t think. Thinking would have talked me out of it. I shouldered my pack, secured the orb in its inner pocket, and waded into the pool. The current tugged at my legs. The water was paralyzingly cold. I pushed through the outer spray, a thousand needling impacts, and stood before the wall of falling water. The sound was all-consuming, a white roar that vibrated in my teeth.

I counted. One. Two. Three.

On the seventh beat, I stepped forward, into the shudder.

The water struck my shoulders, my head, a crushing, cold weight. For a second, there was only the roar and the flood. Then my foot found no purchase—I was falling, not into water, but through air. I landed on smooth, wet stone, stumbling forward into darkness. The roar was instantly muted, replaced by the echo of dripping water and my own ragged breaths.

I fumbled for my headlamp. The beam cut the black, a shaky column of white.

I was in a tunnel. It was not natural. The walls were seamless, a polished black stone that drank the light, but they were also… grown. Rib-like structures arched overhead, not carved, but *formed*, like the roots of a great tree fused with polished obsidian. It was organic engineering. The air was still, cold, and carried that same scent from the hollow in the rain tree: loam, ozone, old stone. And beneath it, the profound, resonant hum. It was in the stone itself, a vibration felt through the soles of my boots.

The tunnel descended. There were no forks, no choices. It simply went down, a gentle, spiralling slope. The silence was absolute, save for the drip of water and the hum. I felt like I was walking into an ear, towards the source of a deep, fundamental note.

After a time I could not measure, the tunnel opened into a chamber. My headlamp beam scattered, unable to find a far wall. The floor was level, covered in a fine, grey dust. And in the centre of the vast space, illuminated by a single, impossible shaft of greenish light that fell from some unseen aperture high above, was the lock.

It was a sphere of the same root-and-stone material, twice my height, suspended in the air by no mechanism I could see. Its surface was covered in a tapestry of the hybrid glyphs, but they were not static. They flowed, slowly, like sap in a living thing, rearranging themselves in a languid, perpetual dance. Around the sphere, floating at various heights, were nine smaller stones, each roughly the size of my fist, each carved into a perfect, complex geometric shape: a dodecahedron, an icosahedron, a shape with too many faces to name.

The message was clear. This was the test. The puzzle lock.

I approached, the dust puffing softly around my boots. The hum was stronger here, a physical pressure in my chest. I unwrapped the orb. The moment it was free of the silk, it reacted. Its own glyphs ignited, casting a pool of emerald and gold light at my feet. The flowing glyphs on the great sphere paused. Then, they began to move faster, swirling into a new configuration.

I understood nothing. Thorne had taught me to feel, to wait, not to solve geometric proofs in a dead language. Panic, cold and slick, started to rise. I was a fraud in a sacred space.

I closed my eyes against the overwhelming sight. The hum filled me. I thought of the rain tree, its patient witness. I thought of the five-foot way, a space for waiting. I was not a scholar. I was a listener.

I opened my eyes and did not look at the sphere. I looked at the dust on the floor. My light caught the faintest of impressions—not footprints, but smooth, shallow grooves radiating from the sphere, almost erased by time. Paths. I followed one with my eyes. It led to a specific spot on the chamber floor, directly in line with one of the floating geometric stones—the dodecahedron.

An idea, fragile as the dust, formed. This wasn’t about solving the sphere. It was about alignment. About placing yourself in the right relation to it.

I walked to the spot aligned with the dodecahedron. I held the orb out before me. The sphere’s glyphs swirled again. One of them—a pattern of interlocking triangles—glowed brightly and seemed to peel away from the surface, projecting into the air before me. It hovered, a holographic key.

I looked at the dodecahedron stone. Its faces, I now saw, were not blank. Each had a tiny portion of a glyph. I reached out, my hand trembling. The stone was warm. I turned it slowly in the air. It moved with a gentle resistance, as if suspended in thick oil. I rotated it until the fragments on its faces aligned, completing the projected glyph.

There was a soft *click*, felt more than heard. The dodecahedron stone floated gently down to rest on a small pedestal I hadn’t noticed in the dust.

One down.

It took hours. It was a meditation of slow movement and deep attention. I would stand in a spot suggested by the grooves in the dust, or sometimes by a new, faint glow from the orb. A glyph would project from the sphere. I would find the corresponding geometric stone—the icosahedron, the complex star-shaped form—and turn it, painstakingly, until the fragments matched. *Click*. Another stone would settle.

My body ached from cold and stillness. My mind was empty of everything but the pattern, the hum, the feel of the cool, living stone under my fingers. There was no fear of the Chronos Guard, no grief for Thorne, no anxiety about what lay ahead. There was only the lock, and my role as its temporary, fragile key.

With the final *click*—a resonant note that hung in the air—the last stone, a beautiful, sixty-faced monster of geometry, settled onto its pedestal. The great sphere ceased its flow. All its glyphs shone at once, a silent, brilliant explosion of green-gold light that forced me to shield my eyes.

Then the light vanished. The sphere was dark. The hum stopped.

The silence was total, a vacuum.

Then, with a sound like a deep sigh, the sphere split along a seam I had never seen. The two halves parted, not mechanically, but like a seed pod opening. Within was not a chamber, but a doorway, filled with a soft, pearlescent radiance.

The Echo Vault.

I stepped through.

The vault was small, circular, and utterly simple. The walls were the same living stone, but here they glowed with their own gentle, bioluminescent light. The air was warm and dry, smelling of parchment and sandalwood. In the centre of the room, on a plain plinth of unadorned wood, sat a single object.

It was not a jewel, a weapon, or a book. It was a lotus pod, made of a dark, petrified wood. It was large, about the size of a human heart, and its surface was pocked with dozens of sealed chambers.

I approached, my footsteps silent. There was no trap, no final guardian. Just the pod on the plinth, and the humming silence returned, softer now, a contented purr.

I reached out and touched it. The moment my fingers made contact, the vault dissolved.

Not the physical vault. The stone walls remained. But my sight was pulled inward, and a recording, not of sight and sound, but of direct experience, unfolded within me.

_I am a builder. My name is Kaelen of the Deep Root. We shaped the world by listening to its song. We grew our cities from the bones of mountains, guided rivers with a thought, wove light into solid form. We called it the Sympathy. It was the art of resonant alignment—with stone, with stream, with star. It was not magic. It was a deeper physics, a conversation with the substance of creation._

_The vision showed wonders: spires of living crystal that sang in the wind, bridges of solidified dawn, archives where memory was stored in the growth rings of ancient trees._

_We grew proud. We stopped listening to the world’s song, and began to impose our own. We sought not harmony, but mastery. We tuned the deep leylines to our own frequency, to amplify our power, to build higher, faster, further from the earth that bore us._

_The vision shifted. The singing spires developed a discordant whine. The living stone of the cities grew brittle, then porous. The rivers we had guided turned sluggish, then toxic. A wasting sickness, not of body, but of connection, spread among us. We were deafening ourselves. The great Sympathy became a feedback scream, a weapon turned inward._

_I am among the last. We have sealed the great resonances, scattered the keys, and turned our final art to forgetting. Our power was our doom. It was a beautiful, terrible addiction. We broke the first rule: to be a space for the song, not the singer._

_The Echo Vaults do not hold our power. They hold our warning. The path you seek is not one of reclamation. It is one of understanding. The Chronos Guard, those who would hunt these keys, they hear only the echo of the scream and think it a call to glory. They are the old sickness, in a new form._

_You who have solved the lock not with force, but with alignment, you have taken the first step. The next will be harder. To find the heart of the Sympathy is to face the choice we failed to make. To listen, and then to walk away._

The experience faded, leaving me on my knees before the plinth, tears cutting tracks through the dust on my face. I was not weeping from sadness, but from a devastating, humbling clarity. Thorne had sought a lost wonder. The woman in the park sought a weapon. I had found an obituary for a godhood, and a mirror.

The petrified lotus pod sat inert. It was not a treasure to be taken. It was the warning itself, delivered. Its job was done.

I stood on shaky legs. The vault’s soft light seemed dimmer. The hum was a fading memory.

A new sound intruded. Faint, sharp, out of place. The crunch of gravel, the scuff of a boot on stone. From the tunnel entrance.

They had found me. The Chronos Guard. They had not needed to solve the lock. They had only needed to follow the one who could.

I looked at the empty plinth, then at the open sphere-doorway behind me. No weapon. No secret exit. Just the recorded ghost of a dead civilization, now living in my bones.

The footsteps grew closer, measured, unhurried. They knew I had nowhere to go.

I turned to face the entrance, my back to the heart of the Sympathy’s failure. The headlamp beam from the tunnel blinded me, cutting through the vault’s dying glow. A figure stepped into the chamber, not the jogger from the park, but a man in tactical gear. He held no weapon. His certainty, like hers, was enough.

“Mr. Tan,” he said, his voice echoing in the stone space. “Thank you for opening the door.”

I said nothing. The dust of the builders was on my hands, their warning in my heart. I was a space, waiting. But now, I was waiting with a secret too heavy to hold, and a choice I did not yet know how to make.

The man smiled. It was the same professional, empty thing.

Outside, in the world of green and grey, the mountain mist continued its endless, patient exhalation.

# Chapter 6

## **Chapter 6**

The light from the headlamp was a physical weight, pressing me back against the cold plinth. It pinned me in the present, a specimen. The man who had spoken—Vex, I would learn—stood inside his own personal sun, a silhouette edged in the vault’s failing luminescence. His lack of a weapon was more unnerving than a drawn gun. It meant the environment was his weapon. I was a rat in his sealed maze.

“The key was never under the frog, was it, Mr. Tan?” Vex said. His voice was dry, polished, like stone worn smooth by indifferent water. “It was in the waiting.”

I kept my hands visible, empty. The dust of the Sympathy was a fine grey powder on my skin. I could still feel the echo of their choice in the hollow of my chest, a resonance like a struck bell damped by a hand. It was not a power. It was a scar.

“I didn’t take anything,” I said. My own voice sounded thin, stripped by the chamber’s acoustics.

“We know.” He took a step forward. Two more figures materialized from the tunnel behind him, moving with a fluid, predatory silence. Their gear was matte, absorbing the light. “You performed the authentication. The system is now… receptive. That is the prize.”

He gestured, a small, economical flick of his fingers. One agent moved left, the other right, flanking the chamber. They began scanning the walls with devices that chirped softly, a sound like mechanical crickets. Vex kept his gaze on me. I was the known variable, the fixed point.

“You seek a wonder,” I said, the words from the memory-vision leaving my lips of their own accord.

Vex’s smile did not change. “I seek a correction. History is a leaky vessel, Mr. Tan. The Chronos Guard patches the holes. What you call ‘wonder’ is often just a particularly dangerous leak.”

The agent to my right, a woman with a severe blonde plait, stopped at a section of wall. “Commander. Residual charge pattern here. Fading, but distinct.”

“Trace it,” Vex said, not looking away from me. “He is the primer. His presence, his… emotional signature, it has woken the circuitry. Now we map it.”

The understanding was a cold trickle. I was not a thief to be caught. I was a catalyst. A living key, already turned. The hum I’d felt, the vision I’d endured—it had left a mark on the vault, and on me. They were using me as a dowsing rod.

I thought of the plinth, now empty behind me. The petrified lotus pod had been a message in a bottle. I had read it. Now the bottle itself was signalling. I had to move. Not to escape—that seemed a childish fantasy—but to become unpredictable. To stop being a fixed point.

I let my shoulders slump, a portrait of defeat. I took a half-step sideways, as if my legs were weak, putting the plinth between Vex and myself. The plinth was not large, but it was stone, and it was the only thing in the room that had mattered.

“The choice they failed to make,” I murmured, as if to myself.

Vex’s head tilted a degree. “What was that?”

“They had a choice. The Sympathy. They could have grasped for godhood. They chose to walk away.”

“A poetic failure,” Vex said. He took another step. The distance between us was now ten feet of open stone. “Sentiment is the luxury of the doomed. We do not have that luxury. The timeline is not a garden to be admired. It is a structure to be maintained. Sometimes that requires pruning.”

The agent on the left chimed in. “I’ve got a parallel stream here, Commander. Fainter. Could be a secondary conduit.”

“Or a drain,” Vex said. “Follow it. Find the junction.”

This was my moment. Their attention was bifurcating, split between the technological readouts and the philosophical captive. I was neither. I was the space between.

I dropped.

Not away, but forward, rolling over the low plinth in a clumsy, graceless motion. My shoulder hit the stone floor on the other side with a jolt. The headlamp beam swept over, blinding, but I was already scrambling, not for the tunnel—a gauntlet of them—but for the open spherical doorway at the chamber’s rear.

“Stop him!” Vex’s command was not a shout, but a sharpened spike of sound.

I plunged into the sphere. It was not a room, but a short, smooth corridor that curved sharply downward. The light from the vault vanished, replaced by a profound, velvet blackness. I ran blind, one hand on the cool, seamless wall, my feet sliding on the incline. The sounds behind me were muffled, then sharpened: boots on stone, a hissed order.

The corridor ended abruptly. I stumbled out into another space, smaller, domed. A faint, sourceless glow seeped from the material of the walls themselves, revealing a circular chamber with three arched niches. In each niche sat a plinth, identical to the first. Two were empty. On the third rested another object.

It was not lotus pod. It was a sphere of what looked like smoked glass, about the size of a clenched fist, suspended within a cradle of twisted, coppery wire. Inside the glass, something moved—a slow, swirling nebula of minuscule silver particles, like a galaxy dreaming in a bottle.

I had no time for awe. This was the heart. The junction.

A shadow filled the corridor entrance. Vex.

I did the only thing I could think of. I reached for the sphere.

My fingers did not touch glass. They passed through it, as if through a membrane of cool water. The sensation was not physical, but synaptic—a sudden, violent connection, like grasping a live wire made of memory. The silver particles flared.

*Image: A vast, underground river of light, flowing through a continent of stone. Three nodes along its length, glowing like hearts. This chamber was one. The other two… coordinates imprinted themselves not as maps, but as feelings. A deep, resonant cold. A crushing, silent pressure.*

*Voice, not the Builder’s, but a chorus of them, whispering in unison: “The triad must sing as one, or the song becomes a scream. The alignment is not a key. It is a chord.”*

Then, a simpler, more recent impression, layered over the ancient one: frustration. Curiosity. A face, sharp-featured, dark eyes wide with a fear that was not of capture, but of complicity. The impression of a hand, *almost* touching this same sphere, then pulling back. A name, thought with the weight of a prayer: *Kaela*.

The connection lasted a second. Two. It was not a vision to be watched, but a data stream to be endured. It flooded my nervous system and receded, leaving me gasping, my hand still plunged into the non-glass.

Vex stood frozen in the archway, his professional calm fissured by raw avarice. “Don’t!”

He lunged.

I pulled my hand free. The swirling silver particles within the sphere coalesced, then pulsed.

A soundless wave of force emanated from the plinth. It did not throw me back. It passed through me, a shudder that vibrated my teeth and made the bones of my skull hum. But it *hit* Vex. It was as if the air in front of him solidified. He struck it at full speed and rebounded, crashing to the floor with a grunt of shock and pain.

The sphere’s glow died to a dim ember. The defensive pulse, triggered by my unauthorized access, had cost it.

I stared at Vex, who was shaking his head, struggling to push himself up. The two other agents appeared behind him, weapons now drawn—compact, ugly things that gleamed dully.

“Non-lethal!” Vex snarled, clawing at the wall to stand. “He is still the primer! Take him!”

I was cornered. The chamber had no other exit. The agents advanced, their weapons raised. They would incapacitate me, then use my subdued presence to milk this chamber, and the others, dry.

Then, from the corridor behind them, a new sound. A sharp, pneumatic *hiss-thud*. One of the advancing agents jerked and collapsed. A small, feathered dart protruded from the seam of his tactical vest.

The second agent spun. Another *hiss-thud*. He fell beside his companion.

Vex turned, his movement pained but fluid, his own weapon appearing in his hand from a thigh holster.

A figure stood in the corridor shadows. Slim, dressed in the same matte tactical gear, but the hood was down. Dark, braided hair. Sharp features. The face from the memory-impression.

“The song isn’t yours to conduct, Commander,” she said. Her voice was low, taut as a wire.

“Kaela.” Vex spat the name. “Sentiment *is* a luxury. And you’ve just bankrupted yourself.”

“I’m cashing in my chips.” Her weapon—a compact tranquilizer pistol—was aimed at his centre mass. “The boy. Now. Or the next dose is calibrated for your metabolism.”

They were five metres apart. A standoff in a tomb. I was the treasure, volatile and useless.

“You think he’s a prophet?” Vex’s laugh was a dry crack. “He’s a tuning fork. We can use him to stabilise fractures you cannot even comprehend.”

“You stabilise nothing,” Kaela said. Her aim did not waver. “You silence. There’s a difference.” Her eyes flicked to me, just for an instant. “Can you move?”

I nodded, my throat tight.

“Then move. To me. Slowly.”

I stepped away from the plinth, my legs unsteady. I walked the perimeter of the chamber, giving Vex a wide berth. His eyes tracked me, calculating. I saw the moment he decided. The cost of losing the primer outweighed the cost of losing a rogue agent. His finger tightened on the trigger of his sidearm.

Kaela saw it too. She fired.

Vex fired.

The world dissolved into noise and movement. I threw myself flat. Kaela’s dart grazed Vex’s arm as he twisted. His shot—a snapping, electric sound—burnt a black scar into the wall where her head had been. She was already moving, diving into the spherical corridor.

“Go!” she yelled at me.

I scrambled after her. A second shot from Vex sparked off the corridor wall, filling the air with the smell of ozone and scorched stone. Then we were around the curve, back in the main vault, sprinting past the empty central plinth toward the tunnel entrance.

Shouts echoed behind us, not Vex’s—he would be pursuing—but others. Reinforcements in the tunnels.

Kaela grabbed my arm at the vault entrance, her grip iron. “Not that way. They’ll have it sealed.” She pointed to the left wall of the vault, to a section of intricate carvings I had taken for mere decoration. She pressed a sequence of raised glyphs. With a deep, grinding groan, a section of stone slid inward, then sideways, revealing a narrow, dark shaft smelling of damp earth and root. A forgotten escape route, or a builder’s passage.

“Down,” she ordered.

We descended a ladder of metal rungs set into the stone. She pulled a lever inside; the door above us slid shut, plunging us into absolute blackness. A small penlight clicked on in her hand. The beam showed a rough-hewn tunnel, sloping steeply downward.

We did not speak. We climbed down, and down, for what felt like years. The only sounds were our ragged breathing, the scuff of our shoes, and the distant, fading vibration of the mountain above us—the sound of a hive stirred to anger.

***

The tunnel ended in a grate, half-hidden by the dripping roots of a giant fig tree. We emerged into the shocking green wetness of the rainforest, far down the mountain slope from the temple complex. The afternoon mist was a tangible presence, swallowing sound and distance. It was the same mist, the same patient exhalation, but it felt different now. It was no longer a blanket of mystery. It was a veil of sanctuary, however temporary.

Kaela leaned against the mossy tree trunk, closing her eyes, listening. After a full minute, she let out a long, controlled breath. “They’ll sweep the perimeter. But this… this is outside their primary search grid. For now.”

I looked at her. In the diffuse green light, she looked younger than her voice suggested, but her eyes were ancient with fatigue and resolve. “Why?” was all I could manage.

She opened her eyes. They were the colour of dark tea. “Because I joined to mend time, not to muzzle it. Vex believes any anomaly is a disease. I started to believe some anomalies might be… symptoms. Of a deeper sickness in the timeline itself. The Sympathy isn’t a leak. It’s a diagnosis.”

She pushed off from the tree. “We can’t stay. They’ll use drones once the ground search fails. We need to get to the city.”

“We?”

“You have the imprint,” she said, starting to walk along a faint animal trail. “The vault’s core message. I felt the secondary resonance when you triggered the sphere. I’ve been monitoring the site for weeks, trying to access it without… without being you. I couldn’t. You’re the first viable primer we’ve found in decades.”

I followed, my mind a jumble of visions, gunshots, and echoing whispers. “It showed me two other places. Feelings, not locations.”

“That’s how their technology works,” she said, ducking under a low-hanging vine. “Cognitive cartography. The data is keyed to lived experience, to emotional and sensory states. It’s why the Guard could never brute-force it. You can’t torture a feeling from a machine.” She glanced back at me. “What did you feel?”

I thought of the impressions. “One was… a deep, resonant cold. Not just winter. Something older. The cold of a place that has never been warm.”

Kaela nodded, her expression grim. “The second?”

“A crushing, silent pressure. The opposite of a mountain. A… depth.”

She stopped, turning to face me. The mist curled between us. “I can translate feelings to coordinates. The Cold—that’s a high-altitude glacial lake in the Tian Shan mountains. A place of extreme stillness. The Pressure…” She hesitated. “The Mariana Trench. The deepest point on the planet.”

A glacial lake. An ocean trench. And a mountain vault. A triad.

“They have to be activated together,” I said, remembering the chorus. “A chord. Not a key.”

“A synchronised resonance,” she whispered, awe cutting through her tension. “Not to unlock a power, but to… to broadcast something. The Sympathy’s final message. Their choice.” She began walking again, faster now. “Vex will have parsed some of this from the residual data. He’ll know the other nodes exist. He won’t know the synchronisation requirement, not yet. He’ll try to secure them, to control the broadcast. We have to get there first.”

“To do what?” I asked, the scale of it drowning me. “To play a chord for a dead civilization? What does that *do*?”

“I don’t know,” she said, and there was a terrifying honesty in it. “But I know what Vex will do. He will try to turn it into a scalpel. To cut out any part of history he deems… unruly. The Sympathy walked away from that kind of power. The Guard would kneel before it.”

We reached a dirt road, little more than a track. An old, battered Suzuki 4x4 was parked under a stand of bamboo, camouflaged with nets. Kaela’s safe-fall vehicle.

As we drove, the mist thinning to a drizzle, the world began to return. The smell of wet earth and petrol. The groan of the suspension. The reality of what was happening settled onto my shoulders, a heavier weight than any secret.

I was no longer Leo Tan, who waited under five-foot ways. I was a primer, a component in a machine of unimaginable age. I had a rogue agent as a guide, and a fanatic as a hunter. I had a chord to play across the spine of the world.

Kaela broke the silence as the city’s first distant lights began to smear the grey horizon. “We need resources. False IDs. Travel routes they won’t predict. I have a contact. A forger. He operates out of a kopitiam in Geylang. He’s… eccentric. But he’s the best, and he has no love for the Guard.”

“Why would he help?”

“Because I saved his daughter from a… temporal eddy. A small one. A loop that had her reliving the same hour of an exam for what felt like weeks. He owes me.” She checked the mirrors, a constant, automatic tic. “We’ll go tonight. It’s the only window we have.”

The rain began again, not a silver wall, but a steady, soaking insistence. It washed the mountain dust from my hands, but not the feeling. The choice of the Sympathy was not mine, not yet. But the running was. The seeking was.

The forger’s name was Ravi, Kaela said. He asked no questions, and told only lies that were more truthful than facts. He was our next step into the unseen world.

As the city swallowed us, tower by tower, I watched the rain on the windshield. Each drop traced a path, a potential route, before being swept away by the wipers. We were like that. Moving on a glass we could not see, pushed by forces we could not control, toward a destination that was only a feeling of cold, and a memory of pressure.

The wait was over. Now came the walk.

# Chapter 7

## **Chapter 7**

The rain in Geylang was a different animal. It wasn’t a solid wall, nor a steady insistence. It was a slick, oily shimmer on neon signs that bled Chinese characters and dubious promises into the wet streets. It clung to the steam rising from perpetual cookpots, a broth of humidity and frying garlic, of sewage and jasmine incense. Our Suzuki, a mud-spattered ghost from the mountains, looked alien here, a creature of raw earth stranded in a circuit-board of desire.

Kaela parked in the lee of a repurposed shophouse, its ground floor a roaring, fluorescent-lit mechanic’s bay. “He’s not in the kopitiam,” she said, killing the engine. The sudden silence was filled by the thump of bass from a nearby karaoke lounge. “He’s above it. The kopitiam is his… listening post. His theatre.”

We slipped through a side door, up a narrow staircase that smelled of stale grease and mildew. The sound of clinking cups and Hokkien chatter rose from below. At the top, a door of reinforced steel, painted a peeling, cheerful green. Kaela knocked a pattern: two quick, three slow, one final, decisive rap.

The door opened on a sigh of cool, dehumidified air.

The room was a cavern of organised chaos. Banks of old radio equipment hummed alongside flat screens streaming global news feeds, sound muted. Maps papered the walls—not just geographical, but topological, temporal charts with swirling, hand-drawn annotations of supposed “currents” and “eddies.” In the centre, at a desk made from a salvaged aircraft hatch, sat Ravi.

He was a small man, all sharp angles and watchful eyes behind thick, magnifying lenses clipped to his spectacles. His hair was a wild grey cloud. He didn’t look up from the passport he was ageing with a careful application of tea and ash. “Kaela,” he said, his voice a dry rustle. “The bill comes due, yes? You are the bill.”

“We need to disappear,” Kaela said, moving into the room as if she owned its shadows. “Singapore, then international. Two sets. Deep background.”

Ravi’s eyes flicked to me, a swift, appraising scan that felt less like being seen and more like being indexed. “Him. The primer. The Guard’s new favourite song.” He set down his brush. “They are not subtle. Their nets are in the immigration databases, the facial recognition queues at Changi. They pulse through the CCTV like a heartbeat. To hide you is to argue with the city’s own eyes.”

“You’ve done harder,” Kaela said.

“For my daughter, I parted a small sea of time. For you?” He shrugged, a bony, economical gesture. “I need a story. Not the truth. A story so good it becomes a fact. Give me a thread.”

It was my turn. Kaela nodded, almost imperceptibly. I heard my own voice, unfamiliar in this room of static and secrets. “We’re researchers,” I said. “Maritime archaeologists. Surveying the drowned sites in the Riau Archipelago. The University of Malaya. There’s a grant.”

Ravi stared at me, unblinking. Then a smile, thin as a razor cut, appeared on his face. “Boring. Competent. Forgivable.” He turned to his screens, fingers flying across a keyboard. “The Guard looks for runners, for spies, for thieves. They do not look for academics. Dullness is a finer cloak than shadow.” He began to mutter, a stream of technical incantation. “I will give you papers, visas, credit histories that will yawn at border guards. You will have published bland articles. You will have university email addresses that work.” He looked back at me. “But the sea… it is not a lie, is it?”

Kaela answered for me. “No. It’s not.”

“Then your destination?”

“The Java Sea. North of the Karimunjawa islands.”

Ravi’s fingers stilled. For the first time, he seemed truly present, the room’s hum receding. “The *Laut Teduh*,” he whispered. The Quiet Sea. “Where the water drinks the sound and the compass forgets north. You seek the second verse.”

The air left the room. Kaela’s hand went to the hilt of her blade. “What do you know of verses, forger?”

He took off his magnifying lenses, his eyes small and piercing. “I listen. That is my currency. I hear the white noise of the world, and sometimes, a pattern sings through. The Guard mobilises not for one rogue, but for a sequence. A priming. They chatter in codes about ‘stanzas’ and ‘restorations.’” He leaned forward. “You go to the sunken city. The one that is not on any chart, because charts are made by men who see only the surface.”

“And if we are?” I asked, the weight of the choice settling again.

“Then your dull archaeologist cover is a good one. And you will need more than false papers.” He swivelled to a rusted filing cabinet, pulling out a tube. Inside was a chart, but not like his others. This was older, vellum, with depths marked in *depa*—the fathom of a man’s outstretched arms. In its centre, a void labelled only *Teduh*. “My grandfather was a fisherman. He spoke of a place where his nets would come up hot, even in the cold deep. Where sometimes, his echo-sounder would show great, straight lines, then nothing. He called it the City of Drowned Light. He said on still nights, you could hear its bells.” Ravi handed me the tube. “A story for a story. Now we are even.”

The transaction was complete. We left with new names in our pockets, and an old map in my hand. The rain had softened to a drizzle. In the Suzuki, the world felt both larger and more narrow. The Guard was a net, but the unseen world had its own currents, and we were being pulled into the deep.

***

We left Singapore under our new names on a rust-streaked survey vessel, the *Kijang*. It was a floating museum of diesel fumes and corroded metal, chartered by our bland, fictional university department. To the crew, we were Dr. Tan and Dr. Sari, politely obsessed with silt samples and sonar anomalies. We kept to our small cabin, its porthole a greasy eye on the churning, green-brown water of the Singapore Strait.

Kaela spent hours cross-referencing Ravi’s chart with the coordinates she had carried in her head. “The Guard knows the general region,” she said one night, the cabin lit by the glow of her tablet. The engine’s vibration was a constant toothache in the bones. “They’ll have watchers on the conventional dive sites, the known wrecks. But the *Laut Teduh*… it sits in a fold. A geomagnetic blind spot. The seafloor there is unstable, volcanic. It makes their instruments dream.”

“How did the Echo build in such a place?” I asked, watching the moonlight fracture on the water outside.

“They didn’t build *in* it,” she said, not looking up. “They built *with* it. Their cities weren’t placed. They were grown, or woven, into the fabric of a location. A sunken city wasn’t a tragedy for them. It was a different phase of the symphony. The vault here won’t be a chamber. It will be a component.”

After two days, the water shifted from silted green to a deep, clear indigo. The air lost the land-smell. On the third morning, the captain, a taciturn Javanese man with salt-cracked lips, pointed ahead. “*Laut Teduh*,” he grunted. “Water is strange. Fish are few. We drop you here. You have eight hours.”

The quiet was the first thing I noticed. The ship’s noises seemed muffled, swallowed. The sea was a flat, breathless pane of glass, reflecting a bleached sky. No birds cried. It was an eerie, waiting silence.

We kitted up in our dive gear—professional, unremarkable. Kaela secured a watertight case to her belt. Inside, the primer. As I checked my gauges, a memory surfaced, unbidden. A story from my own past, a thread that seemed to tremble now against Ravi’s map.

“My grandfather,” I said, the words quiet in the heavy air. “Not the one who told me of the Guard. The other one. My mother’s father. He was a *wayang kulit* puppeteer in Melaka.”

Kaela paused, her hands on her weight belt.

“He had one story he never performed for crowds. Only for family, on certain nights. The story of *Raja Segara*, the King of the Sea. Not a god, but a man who learned the secret language of the deep. In the tale, the king built a palace not of stone, but of ‘frozen song,’ with pillars that were ‘tuned to the moon’s pull.’ He said the symbols of this palace were passed down, hidden in the patterns of *batik* and the movements of the *silat* dance.” I met her gaze. “He drew one for me once, in the dust of his workshop. A spiral, with a line cutting through its centre. He called it the ‘Anchor of the Tides.’ I saw that symbol, Kaela. In the first vault. On the archway.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her stillness deepened. “Family legends are often the echo of an echo. A truth wrapped in parable, surviving where plain history burns.” She handed me a regulator. “The Guard believes the Sympathy is a technology to be controlled. Your grandfather’s story… it suggests it was an art to be understood. A language. That changes the nature of the choice, Leo.”

It did. It wasn’t just about power, or preventing a fanatic from wielding it. It was about comprehension. About hearing a song so old it had become geology. The spiritual seeking wasn’t just in the destination, but in the lineage. My waiting under five-foot ways, my grandfather’s dust-drawn symbols—they were all part of the same, long hesitation before a note is played.

We rolled backwards into the water.

The silence became absolute, broken only by the roar of my own breath. We descended through a column of fading light into a cool, blue twilight. The seafloor here was not the smooth abyssal plain I expected. It was a jagged landscape of black basalt pillars and deep, razor-cut crevasses, like a city shattered by giants and then drowned.

Kaela led, following a handheld sonar unit that painted a ghostly image of the terrain. We swam through canyons, over ridges. And then, the world changed.

The basalt gave way to shape. Not ruins, not in the human sense. There were no collapsed walls, no tumbled columns. Instead, the living rock had been… guided. Curved into great, flowing buttresses that swept up from the seafloor. Smooth, organic arches spanned chasms. It was architecture as reef, as natural formation, but with a profound, unsettling geometry. The scale was vast, humbling. We were insects swimming through the skeletal cathedral of a leviathan.

And there, at the heart of it, was the machine.

It was a mound, a gentle rise in the seafloor, perhaps a hundred metres across. But its surface was a mosaic of interlocking plates, like the carapace of a cosmic beetle. Each plate was inscribed with the now-familiar Echo script, glowing with a faint, bioluminescent blue, a cold fire that pulsed in a slow, tidal rhythm. At its crest, a single, seamless dome of the same material.

This was no hidden chamber. This was an engine. A dormant heart.

We landed on the carapace beside the dome. Close up, the script swirled and coiled, alive with the slow dance of deep-sea currents. Kaela unsealed the case. The primer, in this submerged, ancient place, began to hum, a vibration I felt in my teeth. The blue light on the machine brightened in response, threads of radiance converging towards us.

At the base of the dome, a panel had slid open, revealing a depression. Its shape was not for a hand, or a key. It was a complex, geometric socket.

Kaela examined it, her dive light tracing its contours. She then turned her light to me, making a series of swift, sharp hand signals. *Requires energy source. Modern. High-yield. To wake the system.*

I understood. The first vault required a blood-price, a genetic key. This one demanded a fuel. A sacrifice of our time to awaken theirs.

She pointed to my left side, to the small, hard-case pod strapped to my thigh. My escape pod. Inside was everything I’d kept from my old life that had any practical use: currency, a multi-tool, a fire starter, a miniature water purifier, painkillers, a folding knife. The curated remnants of a man who believed in preparedness. It was powered by a compact, military-grade lithium cell, enough to run a small device for a year. Or to send a distress beacon screaming across a hundred miles.

I looked at the socket. I looked at the pod. The choice was a cold, hard knot in my gut.

This was the walk. Not through rain, but through the consequences of seeking. To progress, I had to surrender my last tangible link to self-reliance, to the practical world of problems solved with tools and power cells. I would be giving up my final insurance policy, placing my survival entirely into the hands of this ancient machine and the rogue agent beside me.

Kaela watched, her bubbles rising in a patient stream. She offered no counsel. This was the primer’s choice.

I unstrapped the pod. It felt absurdly light, a trivial thing against the monumental, sleeping weight of the machine. I turned it over, found the release for the power cell. With a click, it came free, a smooth black rectangle. The pod itself, now inert, was just a plastic shell. I let it drift from my fingers, into the dark water beside the carapace. It vanished quickly, a piece of my old life consumed by the deep.

I slotted the power cell into the socket.

It fit perfectly.

For a moment, nothing. Then, a sound. A deep, sub-audible *thrum* that travelled through the water and up my spine. The bioluminescent script flared, a wave of brilliant blue-white light that raced out from the dome across the entire machine, illuminating the colossal, coiled form of it in the abyssal gloom. The plates of the carapace began to shift, infinitesimally, with a grinding groan of stone on stone that echoed through the water.

The dome irised open.

Inside was not a room, but a nexus. A single, central plinth of crystal, and from it, radiating in three dimensions, lines of light—holographic, or something stranger—threads that connected to points on the inner dome, depicting a star map, or a schematic of impossible complexity. At the plinth’s heart, suspended in the crystal, was the second verse.

It was not a disc. It was a sphere, a tiny, perfect orb of the same resonant material. It pulsed with a soft, inner light, in time with the great machine’s glow.

Kaela swam forward, reverent, and carefully retrieved it. As her fingers closed around it, the entire light-show flickered. The schematic in the dome shifted, the lines reconfiguring, pointing… elsewhere. A third location. The image resolved into a familiar shape: a mountain range, but one rendered with stark, symbolic clarity. A single, double-peaked summit.

A chime sounded in our comms units—the pre-set warning. Two hours of air left. The machine’s light was already fading, the plates settling back into dormancy. Its brief awakening was over, my power cell spent.

We ascended through the darkening water, the sphere a secret sun in Kaela’s case. On the surface, hauling ourselves back into the world of air and noise onto the *Kijang*’s deck, the transition was violent. The silence of the deep was replaced by the ship’s racket, the sun was a brutal hammer on my eyes.

In our cabin, dripping saltwater, we stared at the sphere. The third location was clear. The Double Peaks of Tawangmangu, in Central Java. A place of mist and volcanoes and ancient Hindu-Buddhist temples.

But as Kaela downloaded the navigational data from her dive computer, her face tightened. “The Guard’s net,” she said, her voice flat. “They couldn’t pinpoint the *Laut Teduh*, but they triangulated the energy spike. The primer’s signature, the machine’s awakening. It was a beacon.” She turned the screen to me. It showed a satellite overlay of our position. Two fast-moving contacts, sleek, unmarked cutter-style ships, were converging on our coordinates from north and south. An hour away, maybe less.

“They’re not waiting at the next site,” she said. “They’re coming for the primer itself.”

The captain’s voice barked over the intercom, panicked. Unidentified vessels on radar. Demanding we heave to.

The walk had brought us to the vault. Now it had brought the hunters to our heels. We had the second verse, and the key to the third. But the symphony was turning into a chase, and the next movement would be written in the cold, hard language of pursuit and capture, under a sky that no longer felt like a refuge, but like the lid of a closing trap.

# Chapter 8

## **Chapter 8**

The silence of the deep had been a cathedral. The silence inside the second vault was a tomb. It was the difference between held breath and the absence of any breath at all. We stood on a ledge of fused black stone, the sphere’s light now a low, sullen ember in Kaela’s hands, illuminating a chamber that drank sound and light with equal thirst. The air was cool, sterile, tasting of ancient dust and ozone, a flavour that lingered at the back of the throat like a memory of lightning. The walls were not carved but seemed to have been grown, flowing into arches and niches with the organic logic of a honeycomb or a coral reef. In the centre of the chamber, a pedestal of the same seamless material rose from the floor, its top a shallow bowl, waiting.

The *Kijang* was a world away, a tin can of panic on a tightening sea. The captain’s last transmission had been a static-laced garble. The cutter ships were closing, their profiles on the radar like knife-blades slicing through water. We had maybe forty minutes. The math was simple, brutal. Get the verse, get out, vanish into the archipelago’s thousand veins before the trap shut.

“It feels like a throat,” Kaela whispered. Her voice, usually so solid, was absorbed by the walls, leaving only the ghost of the words.

I placed the primer in the bowl. It was not a fit, but a recognition. The material of the pedestal softened, flowed upwards in a slow, viscous wave, and encased the sphere to its midpoint. The light within it pulsed once, deeply, a heartbeat felt in the bones more than seen by the eyes. Then the chamber awoke.

Light did not flood in. It unfolded. It emerged from the walls themselves, a soft, sourceless bioluminescence that painted everything in shades of blue and grey. The walls were not blank. They were covered in a flowing script, the same language as the primer, but here it moved. Not like a screen, but like water moving over stone, the characters swirling, recombining, telling their story in a river of glyphs. The air thickened, humming with a sub-audible frequency that vibrated in my teeth.

“It’s a playback,” Kaela said, her face tilted up, reflecting the soft dance of light. “A memory of the place.”

But it was more than a memory. The hum deepened, tuned itself to the resonance in my skull—the same frequency that had guided me, the walk that was a listening. The moving script on the walls blurred. The chamber dissolved. Not into darkness, but into a *then*.

***

The vision did not arrive as images. It arrived as senses. I was there, and I was not.

*The sky is a bruised peach, streaked with green. The air is warm, thick with the scent of blooming something—a heavy, cloying perfume that speaks of growth and ripeness. I stand in a city that makes Singapore’s towers look like child’s blocks. Spires of crystalline rock curve towards the sky, not defying gravity but dancing with it. Walkways of light thread between them, and on them, people move. They are tall, graceful, their forms suggested more by light and shadow than by solid flesh. There is no sound of engines, only a low, harmonious tone, the city itself singing a single, sustained note of peace. This is the height. This is the day before the fall.*

*The tone changes. A dissonance. A hunger. It starts in the centre, where a great spire, pulsing with a gentle gold light, begins to throb. The pulse is arrhythmic, greedy. The harmonious tone fractures into competing frequencies. I feel the shift not as sight, but as a nausea in the spirit. They are not just drawing power from the earth’s song anymore. They are amplifying it. Twisting it. They have found the core melody, the primal frequency, and they are feeding it back into itself, a feedback loop of creation, seeking not balance, not understanding, but dominion. They call it the Grand Unison.*

*The sky darkens from peach to liver-purple. The green streaks ignite into sickly phosphorescence. The earth’s song, always there beneath everything, becomes a scream. The crystalline spires do not crack; they shiver, their molecular harmony disrupted. They begin to dissolve from the bottom up, not into rubble, but into a fine, singing sand that pours downwards in silent, beautiful waterfalls. The people on the walkways do not run. They stop. They look up as the sky tears. They open their mouths, not in screams, but as if trying to taste the changing air. Their forms flicker, static on a screen, and then they are simply… not. Unmade. Not by fire or impact, but by the unraveling of the frequency that held them in being. The world is not destroyed. It is de-tuned. The great spire of gold light goes black. Then, it erupts. Not with fire, but with silence. A wave of absolute, annihilating quiet rolls out, and where it passes, the song of the world stops. Stone, light, life—all reduced to a neutral, silent state. Ash without heat. The cataclysm is not an explosion. It is a cancellation.*

*The last thing I perceive is not from the dying city, but from the edges. A handful of figures, their light dimmed, fleeing into deep places. Carrying with them seeds. And a warning, etched not in stone, but in the residual ache of the world’s wronged song: THE WALK IS FOR LISTENING. THE SONG IS NOT A TOOL. TO FORCE THE UNISON IS TO INVITE THE SILENCE.*

***

I came back to myself on my knees. The chamber’s soft light was searing. I was gasping, my hands pressed to the cold floor, vomiting nothing but dry, heaving breaths. The taste of that cloying perfume was in my mouth, the echo of the silent scream in my inner ear. Kaela was beside me, her hand on my shoulder, her face pale.

“Leo. *Leo*.”

“They didn’t lose it,” I choked out. “They broke it. They tried to play the conductor and blew out the orchestra. The power we’re following… it’s the scar tissue. It’s what’s left after they tried to turn a prayer into a weapon.”

Her grip tightened. The practical mind reasserting itself over the horror. “Then the final vault…”

“Isn’t a prize. It’s the source of the wound. The control point for the Grand Unison.” I looked at the pedestal. The primer’s light was steady now, and a new set of glyphs, final and severe, were etched into the air above it. The second verse. The warning.

Kaela was already moving, her dive computer’s camera capturing the hovering glyphs. “We have it. Now we go. We have to beat Vex to the third site, seal it, bury it—”

The chamber’s hum shifted pitch. It was no longer the deep, remembering tone. It was the alert shriek of a tripped wire. The light turned a harsh, antiseptic white.

“He’s not waiting for the third site,” a voice said, its timbre smooth, amplified, and utterly out of place in the ancient air.

From the entrance tunnel, shadows resolved into figures. They moved with a trained, fluid silence, clad in matte-black tactical gear, weapons not raised but held ready. And between them, moving as if he owned the silence, was a man in a grey linen suit, untouched by the sea or the climb. Vex. His hair was silver, cut close, his face a study in intelligent calm. He held a small, rectangular device—a field resonator, tuned to disrupt the vault’s harmonics. It was the source of the harsh white light.

“He’s here for the primer,” I said, the words ash in my mouth.

Vex smiled. It was a small, polite thing. “Mr. Tan. Ms. Sari. You’ve saved me considerable time. And you,” he said, his eyes settling on me, “have confirmed the hypothesis. The vision. Quite a thing, isn’t it? The folly of god-kings who lacked conviction.”

Kaela moved, a blur of instinct, snatching the primer from the pedestal. The chamber groaned. Two of Vex’s men were on her before she took a step. They were efficient, brutal. A strike to the brachial plexus. Her arm went numb. The sphere clattered on the stone. It did not break. It rolled, coming to rest at Vex’s polished shoes.

He bent and picked it up, cradling it with a scholar’s care. “Thank you.”

“You saw the same vision,” I said, pushing myself to my feet. My legs felt like water. “You know what it did. What it *is*.”

“I saw a failure of nerve,” Vex corrected, his voice a lecturer’s drone. “They grasped the fundamental frequency of reality—the source code of creation—and when it began to buck, they panicked. They tried to shut it down. A clumsy, catastrophic abort.” He stepped closer, his eyes bright with a fervent, icy light. “They were composers who feared their own symphony. The Grand Unison isn’t a cataclysm, Mr. Tan. It is a reset. A return to a blank slate, upon which a new, ordered world can be written. One without the noise, the chaos, the stubborn, singing mess of humanity. The Silence they feared is the necessary pause before the perfect note.”

He was insane. Not with rage, but with a clean, logical insanity that was far more terrifying.

“You want to trigger it,” Kaela spat, held firmly between the guards.

“Control it,” Vex said. “Channel it. The old world ended because the process was runaway, undirected. The primer and the final vault are the regulator. With them, the Unison can be focused. Surgical. A scalpel, not a bomb. Imagine it. A frequency that can unmake a city, a government, a rebellious thought, at its source. Not with bullets, but with a… correction. The ultimate peace.”

“You’ll kill millions,” I said.

“I will silence the cacophony,” he replied. “And from that silence, build a world that *makes sense*.” He looked at the primer in his hand. “You found the walk. You listened. But you misunderstood the song. It is not a lullaby. It is a command.”

He nodded to his men. They forced Kaela towards the tunnel. She fought, silent, fierce, her eyes finding mine. They weren’t pleading. They were instructing. *Do something.*

I lunged. Not for Vex, but for the nearest guard, for his weapon. I was slow, clumsy, still unmoored from the vision. A blow caught me on the temple. The world flashed white, then grey. I hit the floor, the taste of blood and ancient dust filling my mouth.

Vex looked down at me, a faint disappointment in his gaze, like a tutor watching a promising student fail a simple test. “You have a gift, Mr. Tan. A sensitivity. It’s a pity you chose to wander, instead of to lead.” He turned to leave, then paused. “The surface team reports your ship is… compliant. We’ll be taking Ms. Sari. Her expertise on the geological triggers will be useful at Tawangmangu. You, however… this place is a fitting end for a walker. A tomb for a listener.”

He made a small gesture. One of his men placed a compact charge on the pedestal, then another at the entrance tunnel. “The sea will do the rest. More elegant than a bullet.”

They left, taking the light, taking Kaela, taking the sphere. The harsh white glare from Vex’s device vanished, plunging the chamber back into its own soft bioluminescence. I heard their footsteps recede. Then, a deep, shuddering *crump* from the tunnel entrance. The sound of stone fracturing. A second later, a low, groaning roar began, the sound of water finding a new path.

The chamber was flooding.

***

The water did not rush in. It arrived. A solid, black tongue licking from the entrance tunnel, swallowing the light as it came. It was cold, a shock that cleared the fog from my head even as it promised a deeper oblivion. The math was simple again. The chamber was a sealed bowl. The entrance was the only pipe. That pipe was now clogged with rubble and filling fast. I had minutes, maybe less.

Panic was a luxury. The vision had left a residue, a map of desperation in my mind. I pushed myself up, slipping on the wet stone. The water was already ankle-deep, chillingly intimate. I looked at the pedestal. The charge on it was a small, blinking eye of red light. It would go last, ensuring the central mechanism was destroyed. The final verse, the warning glyphs, were gone, absorbed back into the walls.

*The walk is for listening.*

But I had listened. I had heard the scream. I had felt the Unison. And in the vision, in the moment of catastrophic feedback, I had seen—*felt*—the architecture of their control. It was a system of resonant pathways, like a nervous system for the planet. And in any nervous system, there are redundancies. Emergency shut-offs. Backdoor signals for when the main brain is failing.

The water was at my knees, pulling at me. The groan of pressure was a constant note. I waded to the wall where the glyphs had flowed most strongly. I placed my palms against the stone. It was not inert. A faint vibration, the last echo of the machine’s awakening, still trembled within it. I closed my eyes. I let go of the cold, of the rising water, of the image of Kaela being dragged away. I reached for the resonance in my own skull, the tuning fork the walk had left inside me.

I did not push. I hummed. A low, steady note, matching the fading vibration in the wall. It was not about force. It was about alignment. A plea in the same key.

Nothing.

The water was at my waist. The cold was a clamp on my lungs. The bioluminescence on the walls seemed to dim, as if drowning.

I thought of the final moment of the vision. Not the silent wave, but the flight. The ones who fled into the deep places. They would have left a way. Not for power, but for preservation. A failsafe for future listeners, not conquerors.

I shifted the mental frequency. Not the song of control, nor the scream of its breaking. I sought the quieter note beneath both: the earth’s original, wounded hum. The scar tissue. I let my own breath rasp in time with it, a broken thing.

A section of the wall under my right hand shimmered. Not with light, but with a different density. A circle, the size of a plate, became faintly transparent. Behind it was a lattice of crystalline filaments, pulsing with a weak, tired blue light. A secondary node. A drainage synapse.

I had no tools. No time. The water was at my chest. I pressed my forehead to the cool, shimmering circle. I poured every ounce of that broken resonance into it, not a command, but a confession of failure. *We are listening. We are sorry.*

The circle dissolved. The lattice of filaments was exposed. I didn’t think. I drove my fist into it.

There was no shock. No pain. The filaments were brittle, ancient. They shattered with a sound like distant wind chimes. The weak blue light surged once, then died.

For a second, nothing. Only the cold, rising water.

Then, a deep, grinding shudder passed through the chamber. From the entrance tunnel came a new sound—not the inrushing roar of water, but a vast, gulping *slurp*. A whirlpool formed in the centre of the chamber, spinning the black water. A hidden duct, an ancient overflow, had been triggered. The water level stalled at my sternum. Then, with agonizing slowness, it began to drop.

I clung to the wall, shuddering with cold and a relief so violent it felt like a new kind of sickness. The water drained away, revealing the chamber floor, carved with channels I hadn’t seen. It took an age. When it was finally only a slick, black sheen, I collapsed, lying on the stone, gasping air that was now laced with the salt and rot of released sea.

I was alive. I was trapped. But I was not defeated.

The pedestal still stood, the charge on it blinking its steady, red metronome. I crawled to it. The failsafe had drained the chamber, but the vault’s primary systems were dead. The bioluminescence was gone, leaving only the hellish blink of the charge. In that intermittent light, I saw something else.

Where the primer had sat, where the pedestal’s material had flowed up to embrace it, a pattern was faintly glowing. Not the grand, hovering glyphs of the verse. This was smaller, subtler. A network of fine lines, like the veins on a leaf or the tributaries on a map. At its centre was a single, steady point of pale light. And from that point, a thin, tenuous thread of resonance reached out, a ghost of a connection.

I understood. The primer was the key. But it was also a transmitter. And this pedestal was a receiver. Vex had taken the transmitter, but he had not severed the link. Not yet. This faint glow was the echo. The backup signal. A whisper where there had been a shout.

I placed my hand over the faint, glowing point. The connection was weak, fragile as a spider’s silk stretched across a chasm. But it was there. It was a thread. And it led out of this tomb, through the rock and the sea, across hundreds of kilometres, to the Double Peaks of Tawangmangu. To the final vault. To Kaela.

The charge on the pedestal beeped, accelerating. A final, five-second warning.

I turned and ran, not for the blocked entrance, but for the newly-revealed overflow duct—a dark, sheer hole in the chamber floor, still dripping. I had no idea where it led. Only that it was not sealed.

I dropped into the dark, just as the world behind me dissolved into a soundless, consuming flash of white. Not an explosion of force, but a pulse of perfect, annihilating silence that swallowed the last echo of the ancient song.

I fell through cold, rushing blackness, the thread of resonance from the primer a faint, singing knot in my mind. A compass needle. A leash. A lifeline.

The walk was over. Now came the chase.

# Chapter 9

## **Chapter 9**

The silence after the pulse was a new kind of sound. It was the ringing in your ears after a gunshot, but deeper, a vacancy that had weight and texture. I surfaced from the overflow duct not into the sea, but into a subterranean river, a black, icy current that carried me through a throat of basalt. The world was reduced to the slap of water on stone, the burn of my lungs, and the faint, singing knot in my mind.

The thread.

It was not a sound, not a light. It was a pressure behind my eyes, a subtle tilt in my sense of balance, as if the planet had shifted its axis by a single, critical degree. It pulled east-southeast. A spiritual gravity. I clawed my way onto a slick shelf of rock, the darkness absolute, and lay there, shivering. The vault was gone, erased by that silent, white annihilation. All that remained of its song was this one, tenuous filament, connecting the primer in Vex’s possession to the receiver in my skull.

I followed it out. The river led to a crack in a mossy cliff-face, hidden behind a curtain of thorny *simpur air* vines, on a deserted stretch of the southern Java coast. The sky was the colour of a fresh bruise, dawn bleeding into a stormy morning. The rain here was different from Singapore’s solid walls. It was a warm, persistent mist that turned the jungle into a steaming green lung. The air smelled of wet earth, clove, and the distant, sulphurous breath of the island’s volcanoes.

I had nothing. No pack, no weapon, only the soaked clothes on my back and the hard, certain pull of the thread. It was a compass needle etched into my consciousness. I could feel the primer moving, a bright, sharp point of wrongness travelling inland, north and east, towards the highlands. A convoy. Vex was not creeping. He was claiming.

The walk was over. Now came the chase.

I moved not like a man, but like a shadow the jungle had decided to spit out. I stole a fisherman’s motorbike from a lean-to by a stilt village—a rattling, puttering thing with a cracked plastic seat. I left a stack of sodden, worthless rupiah from my pocket and a silent apology in the air. The thread was a leash, and it was tightening. I could feel the distance between us not in kilometres, but in the increasing tautness of that psychic line, a hum that was building towards a harmonic. The map in my mind, once fragmented and silent, was now alive. The first vault in Singapore, a whisper of urban decay. The second in the Java Sea, a silent, drowned chord. And now, the third, a growing, resonant peak ahead, a dormant super-volcano called Gunung Lawu. The Double Peaks of Tawangmangu were its shoulders.

The three points were not a triangle. They were a tuning fork. And the primer was the mallet about to strike it.

***

The highlands rose around me, the road a wet, grey ribbon clinging to the slopes. Tea plantations gave way to dense, mist-wreathed pine forests, the air growing thin and cold. The thread vibrated. They were close, ahead on this same winding pass, the only viable route for vehicles towards the old pilgrimage trails of Lawu. I abandoned the bike in a ditch, its engine coughing to silence. The rain had softened to a drizzle, the mist lying in the valleys like discarded wool.

I climbed. The rock was slick, the pine needles silent underfoot. From a high outcrop, I saw them: three black, armoured SUVs moving like beetles through the fog below, navigating a narrow section of road carved between a sheer rock face and a precipitous drop into a ravine. A perfect bottleneck. The thread sang, a painful, beautiful note. The primer was in the middle vehicle. And with it, a fainter, familiar resonance—Kaela. A muted, captive harmony.

The environment was not a backdrop; it was the only weapon I had. Above the road, the recent rains had left the cliff face weeping, a section of fractured rock and sodden earth held back by a net of ancient tree roots. A precarious geology. A prayer waiting to be answered.

I did not think. I moved. The climb was a vertical scramble, fingers seeking purchase in wet cracks, the world shrinking to the next handhold, the next root. I reached the unstable shelf above the road. The roots were thick as my wrist, straining. Below, the lead SUV was passing through. Then the middle one, carrying my song. I braced my feet against a solid rock, took a deep breath of the thin, pine-scented air, and began to push against the main anchor-root, a groaning, fibrous cable.

It was not about strength. It was about leverage. It was about listening to the sigh of the earth. I pushed into the rhythm of the mountain, a slow, grinding patience. The root creaked. A shower of pebbles and mud pattered down onto the road, spattering the windshield of the middle SUV. It slowed.

I pushed again, a steady, relentless pressure. The thread in my mind was a scream now. The root snapped with a sound like a cannon shot.

The world came down. Not in a single, dramatic avalanche, but in a rushing, roaring cascade of mud, rock, and shattered timber. It fell between the lead SUV and the convoy, a sudden, earthen wall six feet high, cutting the middle vehicle off. The third SUV braked hard, skidding on the wet asphalt.

Silence, for a heartbeat. Then shouts. Doors opening on the third vehicle. Armed figures emerging, scanning the cliffs.

I was already moving, sliding down the slope I had made, half-swimming in the churned mud, coming down behind the isolated middle SUV. The driver’s door opened. A man in tactical gear stepped out, rifle raised. He didn’t see me, a mud-smeared spectre rising from the earth itself. One strike to the throat, a twist to disarm. He fell, gagging, into the muck.

The thread was a physical pull. I yanked open the SUV’s rear door.

The interior was a capsule of sterile light and cool air. Vex sat on the far side, a sleek case on his lap, his hand inside. His eyes, flat and calculating, met mine. Between us, bound and gagged in the middle seat, was Kaela. Her eyes were wide, not with fear, but with a furious, blazing recognition. A map of bruises bloomed on her temple, but her resonance was clear, a bell waiting to be rung.

“Leo,” Vex said, his voice calm, almost pleasant. “You are a stain of remarkable persistence.”

My gaze was locked on the case. The primer was inside. I could feel its output, a focused beam of ancient data screaming silently into the ether, aimed at the final vault. It was an open wound in the world’s quiet.

“It’s not a treasure map, Vex,” I said, my voice raw from swallowed seawater and grit. “It’s a lock.”

“All locks have keys,” he smiled. His finger was on a trigger inside the case. “And all keys confer power. You simply lack the imagination to see its shape.”

He moved fast. But the thread moved faster. It wasn’t a thought; it was a reflex. As he raised the case, aiming not at me, but at Kaela, I didn’t lunge for him. I threw myself onto Kaela, wrapping around her, turning my back to the case. I felt a *thump*, not of a bullet, but of a concussive, resonant wave. It passed through me like an X-ray, a burst of discordant frequency meant to disrupt, to shatter a tuned mind. My own connection to the thread screamed in agony, a feedback shriek, but it held. Behind me, Vex grunted in surprise.

In that second of his miscalculation, Kaela moved. Bound as she was, she drove her head back into the headrest, rocking the seat. It was enough. I reached back, blind, my hand finding the case. My fingers closed not on the primer, but on the cabling around it. I pulled. There was a crackle of severed connection, a dying digital squeal.

The primer’ broadcast stuttered.

Vex roared, a sound of pure, profane rage. He clawed at me, but the SUV’s cabin was a cage. Shots rang outside—his men, firing at shadows in the mist. I had the case. I dragged Kaela out with me, into the cool, drizzling chaos. With a slash of a discarded knife from the mud, I cut her bonds.

“The pass,” she gasped, rubbing her wrists. Her eyes were on the case. “He’s rigged it. It’s a dead man’s switch linked to his biometrics. If his heart stops, it broadcasts a full-trigger sequence.”

Of course. A final spite. A burn-it-all-down clause.

“Then we don’t stop his heart,” I said, pulling her towards the ravine edge. “We run.”

We went over the side, sliding and tumbling into the dense, concealing pines as the shouts and gunfire concentrated on the blocked road above. We left him there, trapped with his crippled weapon and his wall of earth, the thread now a tangled, angry snarl in my mind. But we had the primer. The physical key. And the map in my head was now complete, the final glyphs slotting into place with a silent, profound *click*.

***

We found shelter in a pilgrim’s cave, a shallow scoop in the rock face smelling of old ash and damp stone. A small, clear spring trickled down one wall. I opened the case with careful, trembling hands.

The primer sat inside, cradled in black foam. It was no longer inert. It glowed with a soft, internal light, its surface alive with the flowing, vein-like patterns I had seen in the pedestal. It was warm to the touch. Not with heat, but with potential. Kaela watched, her breath fogging in the cold air.

I placed my hands on it.

The world did not vanish. It clarified.

The three vaults blossomed in my consciousness not as points, but as pillars. Singapore, the Foundation, rooted in the engineered stone of human ambition. The Java Sea, the Depth, anchored in the primordial ooze. And here, Lawu, the Apex, reaching for the sky from the planet’s fiery heart. They were not a circuit to be powered. They were a triad of tuning pins, holding a string in perfect, impossible tension.

The string was the tectonic suture line beneath the archipelago. The lock was a stabilizer. The verse wasn’t an invitation to claim power. It was a schematic for maintenance. A sacred duty. The ‘reward’ for solving the puzzle was the crushing, eternal responsibility of ensuring the lock held. The art was not in the opening, but in the perpetual, careful act of *not* closing it. A valve on a pressure cooker the size of a world.

I understood it all in a single, devastating instant. The knowledge was not exhilarating. It was a weight, a yoke settled onto my shoulders. I saw the faces of the Versehunters who had come before—not as greedy adventurers, but as failed stewards. They had sought a prize. They had found a burden. And they had broken under it, or fled, leaving the lock to slowly degrade.

And Vex… Vex wanted to break it deliberately. To use the released energy of a cataclysmic geological event as a weapon, or a currency. He saw a bomb where there was a bearing.

I took my hands from the primer. The vision faded, but the understanding remained, etched into me like a scar.

Kaela saw it on my face. “What is it?”

“It’s not a treasure,” I said, my voice hollow in the small cave. “It’s a chore. The most important chore in the world.”

I told her. The pillars. The lock. The suture line. The stabilization field that quieted the fury beneath these islands. She listened, her eyes growing darker, absorbing the scale of it.

“So the vaults… they’re not full of gold or secrets,” she said slowly.

“They’re full of a single instruction: *Keep this turned on*.”

She was silent for a long time, watching the mist curl past the cave mouth. Then she nodded, a small, firm gesture. “Then that’s what we do.”

“It’s a lifetime,” I said. “It’s every lifetime after this one. It’s a chain.”

“It’s a thread,” she corrected softly, looking at the glowing primer. “You followed one here. This is just a thicker one.” She met my eyes. “He’s still coming. He’ll be on foot now, too. And he has the receiver coordinates. He doesn’t need the primer to break the lock. He just needs to get to the Apex vault and start cutting wires.”

She was right. The chase wasn’t over. It had just changed its nature. We weren’t running to claim something. We were running to protect it. To become its guardians.

The spiritual seeking had found its answer. It was not enlightenment. It was work. It was the mundane, eternal task of holding back the dark. It was the most profound thing I had ever been offered.

“We need to get there first,” I said.

“Yes.”

“And we can’t kill him.”

“No,” she agreed. “We have to out-think him. We have to become part of the lock he can’t pick.”

We drank from the spring. The water was clean, tasting of stone and altitude. We shared a single protein bar from a survival kit in the SUV case. The mist began to lift, shredding on the pine tops, revealing the towering, twin peaks of Lawu above us, their upper slopes bare and severe against the rushing grey sky. The final vault was up there, somewhere in that ancient, sacred silence. The Apex.

The primer’s glow had steadied to a gentle pulse, in time with my own heartbeat. It was no longer a foreign object. It was a tool. A responsibility. I closed the case. The hum diminished to a bearable whisper in my bones.

We left the cave as the first true light of afternoon broke through, casting long, skeletal shadows from the pines. We began to climb, not as thieves, but as pilgrims. The path was steep, the air thinning with every step. The thread in my mind was no longer a tether pulling me. It was a path I was choosing to walk.

Behind us, far below in the ravine of the broken road, I could feel it—a discordant vibration, a snarled and angry knot of will moving through the trees. Vex. Coming. He would not stop. The world, for him, was a series of doors to be kicked in. He would reach the Apex vault, and he would try to break the oldest lock in the world.

Our job was to be there when he did. Not to fight him for a prize.

But to show him the door he was about to open led only to the fire. And to stand in its frame.

The climb was no longer a chase. It was a consecration. Each step was a word in a vow I had not known I was born to take. The cold air burned my lungs. The primer’s weight in my hand was the weight of continents.

Above, the Double Peaks waited, silent and immense. The final chamber. The last verse.

We climbed.

# Chapter 10

## **Chapter 10**

The climb was a consecration. The air was a blade, honed on the high stone of Lawu’s shoulders, and it pared away everything that was not essential. Thought became breath. Breath became step. The world narrowed to the volcanic grit under my boots, the ache in my thighs, the steady, sympathetic pulse of the primer in its case against my back. Kaela moved ahead of me, a silhouette against the rushing grey, her movements economical as a prayer. We did not speak. The path was speech enough.

It led us out of the pine forest and onto a spine of ancient lava flow, a black, twisted river of rock frozen in mid-cataract. The mist had burned away, and the scale of the place unveiled itself. We were on the rim of the caldera. It was not a crater, not as I had imagined. It was a world within a world. A vast, bowl-shaped valley cupped between the twin peaks, its floor a tapestry of impossible green threaded with silver streams and the white plumes of geothermal vents. The air here was different. It carried a scent beneath the cold—a tang of sulphur, of wet stone, of something deeply and electrically alive. The silence was not an absence, but a presence. It had weight, texture. It was the silence of a held breath.

The primer’s hum shifted. It was no longer a thread in my mind, but a compass needle. It pointed down, into the heart of the green bowl.

“There,” Kaela said, her voice barely disturbing the air. She pointed to a scar on the opposite rim, a raw, recent gash in the vegetation. A landslide. “He didn’t follow the path. He cut straight through. He’s already inside the caldera.”

He was a discordance. I could feel it now, not as a knot of anger, but as a tear in the fabric of the silence. A violent, scraping impatience moving through the sacred bowl. Vex.

Our descent was less a climb than a controlled fall. We half-ran, half-slid down the inner wall of the caldera, through thickets of fern and rhododendron that showered us with cold diamonds of leftover rain. The geothermal activity grew more pronounced. Patches of ground steamed, hissing like kettles. Strange, mineral-stained pools bubbled with a lazy, malevolent heat. The air grew warm and damp in patches, then bitingly cold again. This was not a landscape. It was a body. We were moving across the skin of a sleeping giant, feeling its heat, its breath.

The ancient defenses were not walls or gates. They were the giant itself.

We crossed a meadow of soft, emerald moss. Kaela stopped me with an arm. “Watch the step.” She nudged a stone with her toe. It rolled forward onto the moss and vanished with a soft, sighing *puff*, leaving a hole that exhaled a plume of warm, sulphurous steam. The entire meadow was a thin crust over a network of fumaroles. A path of slightly darker, firmer moss wound through it, almost invisible. A test of awareness. A test of respect. Vex’s path was a brutal, straight-line scar of broken crust and churned earth, steam jetting from the wounds he’d torn in the skin.

“He’s not navigating,” I whispered. “He’s violating.”

“To him, it is the same thing,” Kaela said, her eyes on the trail of vandalism. “A lock is a thing to be broken. A test is an insult.”

We followed the true path, our progress a silent, careful dance. The primer’s pulse was a drum now, low and deep, felt in the teeth. It was leading us toward the centre of the caldera, where the plumes of steam were thickest, coiling into the sky like the pillars of a forgotten temple.

Then the world erupted behind us.

Not with fire, but with sound. A shout, the crack of a branch, the hard, metallic chitter of a weapon being armed. We spun. Four figures in the grey-green tactical gear of the Guard’s rear detachment emerged from the tree line on the caldera slope we’d just descended. They moved with a professional, sweeping lethality. They had not taken the path. They had come straight down, fast and loud, and they had our scent.

“Go,” Kaela said, and her voice was flat, final.

“No. Together.”

“The path is single-file here. They will bottle us. One holds, one goes. That is the math.” She was already shrugging off her pack, pulling a compact, matte-black device from it—a non-lethal pulse inducer, designed to overload electronics and disorient neural systems. A tool for a Warden. “The vault is close. I can feel it. You have the primer. You have the thread. Follow it.”

“Kaela—”

“This is not a sacrifice, Leo. It is a tactic. I will delay, I will misdirect, I will lead them on a merry dance through this steam bath. Then I will catch up.” She met my eyes. There was no fear in her face, only a fierce, practical light. “You must be the one at the door. You carry the invitation. I am just the usher. Now, *go*.”

The first stun-round whined past, vaporising a plume of steam. The choice was made, carved out by the geometry of the path and the cold calculus in her eyes. I turned and ran, the primer’s case a burning brand against my spine, its hum a scream of urgency.

I did not look back. I heard the sharp *crack-thrum* of Kaela’s device, a shouted curse, the sizzle of electronics frying. Then the sounds were swallowed by the hiss of vents and the hammering of my own blood. I followed the dark moss, the pulse in my bones, the tearing in my chest that had nothing to do with the altitude.

The caldera’s centre resolved through the veils of steam. It was not a cave mouth or a grand arch. It was a grove. A circle of immense, gnarled *sugi* trees, their roots like stone, cradling a natural amphitheatre. In the centre stood a monolith. It was black, glassy obsidian, shaped by no human hand, yet standing with a perfect, poised balance. It was a keystone. The geothermal plumes rose thickest here, wreathing the grove in a shifting, spectral light. The air vibrated. The very ground seemed to hum a fundamental, subsonic note.

The Apex Vault. The lock was not on the stone. The stone *was* the lock. And the entire caldera, the breathing, steaming, living mountain, was its mechanism.

Vex stood before the monolith.

He looked smaller than I remembered, a stark, black-clad figure against the towering obsidian. He had set up a portable console, its screens casting a sickly, blue glow on the wet ground. Cables snaked from it to probes he had jammed into fissures around the monolith’s base. He was not trying to pick the lock. He was trying to give the mountain a stroke.

I slowed, my breath ragged clouds in the steam. He hadn’t heard me. His entire being was bent over the console, his fingers flying across the interface. I saw the problem on the screens—a cascading series of cryptographic prompts, environmental checks, biometric resonances. He was brute-forcing them, using a bank of shimmering, prism-like data-crystals to simulate the required keys. He was trying to shout the mountain into submission.

And the mountain was groaning in response.

A deep, grinding tremor shook the ground. Gravel danced. The *sugi* trees creaked. A jet of steam from a nearby vent roared with sudden, furious intensity. On his screen, a warning glyph flashed—a stylised mountain with a crack down its centre. He was bypassing the protocols, and in doing so, he was destabilising the geothermal pressures that the vault’s mechanisms carefully balanced. He was causing seismic tremors.

He was going to blow the top off the sacred mountain to get to the treasure inside.

I stepped into the clearing. The primer in my hand was no longer humming. It was singing. A clear, pure tone that resonated with the monolith, with the trees, with the deep hum of the earth.

Vex’s head snapped up. His face, illuminated by the console’s glow, was slick with sweat and rapt with a terrible, focused joy. It didn’t falter when he saw me. It widened into a grin.

“The librarian!” he called out, his voice cutting through the rumble. “You’re just in time for the grand opening! I’m almost through the final buffer. The old ghosts put up quite a firewall.”

“You’re not opening it,” I said, my voice sounding strange and thin in the heavy air. “You’re triggering a containment failure. Look at your seismics.”

He waved a dismissive hand, not looking away from his screen. “Side effect of talking loudly to a deaf old machine. Once I’m in, I’ll have control. I can quiet it down. The power in there… it’ll let me calm a dozen volcanoes.” Another tremor, stronger this time. A crack splintered up the face of a nearby boulder. “See? It’s waking up.”

“It’s dying,” I said, walking closer. The primer’s song was a vibration in my palm, a wordless argument. “This isn’t a machine, Vex. It’s a covenant. You’re breaking the terms.”

He finally turned to look at me fully, his eyes gleaming with that intellectual hunger that knew no morality. “Covenants are for people who need permission. Power doesn’t have terms. It has applications.” His gaze dropped to the primer in my hand. His grin turned razor-sharp. “Ah. You brought the key. Good. Saves me the trouble of spoofing the last resonance. Hand it over. You can watch.”

“No.”

The syllable hung in the steam. It wasn’t a shout. It was a statement, flat and solid as the monolith itself. It seemed to surprise him. The manic energy around him stilled for a fraction of a second.

“No?” he echoed, amused. “Librarian, look around you. The Guard is minutes behind you. Your Warden is probably already wrapped in a shock-cuff. You have a tool. I have the skill to use it. This,” he gestured to the trembling mountain, “is happening. The only question is whether you walk away with a share of the future, or become a footnote buried in it.”

I moved to the other side of the monolith, facing him across the black glass. I placed my free hand on its surface. It was warm, almost feverish. The primer’s song flowed into it, and for an instant, the tremor lessened.

“You think this is about a share,” I said. “It’s not. You think the power in there is a weapon, or a battery, or a lever. It’s not.”

“Enlighten me.” He tapped a command into his console. Another, deeper groan shuddered through the amphitheatre. Dust trickled from the roots of the great trees.

“It’s a memory,” I said, the words coming not from my mind, but from the resonance flowing through my hand. “A perfect, preserved memory of balance. Of a world where power wasn’t extracted, it was participated in. The Apex isn’t a stockpile. It’s a template. The last verse of an instruction manual for a planet.”

Vex snorted. “Poetic. And useless. The planet is a resource. A system to be optimised. This ‘template’ is a set of shackles invented by primitives who were afraid of the dark.”

“They weren’t afraid of the dark,” I said, my voice rising to meet the growing rumble. “They were *respectful* of it. They understood that some fires you bank, you don’t stoke. Some doors you watch, you don’t open. You see a lock to be picked. They saw a door that kept a fire contained.”

“And I’m the fire?” he asked, genuinely intrigued.

“You’re the man who’d break the door to steal the flames, and burn down the temple to keep himself warm for a night.”

He paused, his fingers hovering over the console. For a moment, I saw something else in his eyes—not doubt, but a flicker of profound, almost academic disappointment. “So small,” he murmured. “You hold a key to the universe, and you see only… a thermostat. A moral lesson carved in stone.” He shook his head. “A shame.”

He entered the final command.

The console screens flared white. The probes jammed into the rock blazed. The monolith’s deep hum rose to a shriek. The ground didn’t tremble—it lurched. A section of the amphitheatre floor, ten feet to my left, slumped inwards with a roar, collapsing into a steaming crevasse. The *sugi* trees swayed violently. The sky seemed to darken.

And the face of the monolith changed.

Where there had been smooth obsidian, a spiral of light appeared. It was cool, blue-white, and deep within it, geometries shifted and turned, aligning. An aperture irised open in the very centre of the spiral. Not a physical door. A hole in reality, leading into a space that glowed with a soft, earth-core light.

The Apex was open.

Vex let out a triumphant, wordless cry. He moved toward the light, his console forgotten.

I didn’t try to tackle him. I didn’t shout. I simply raised the primer and stepped into the light’s path, between him and the aperture.

He stopped, inches from me. His excitement curdled into impatience, then into something dangerous. “Move.”

“You wanted the key,” I said. The primer was blazing now, its light merging with the light from the vault. “Here it is. But it’s not a physical thing. It’s a state of being. It’s understanding what you’re about to destroy. You can’t bypass that. You have to become it. Or you go no further.”

He laughed, a short, ugly sound. “You’re going to *stand in my way*? With what? A poignant metaphor?”

“With the door,” I said.

And I understood it then, the final, shattering truth. The primer wasn’t just a key. It was a *part* of the lock. And so was the person holding it, if they were aligned with its purpose. I wasn’t just blocking the aperture. I was extending the lock’s protocol. I was the final question the vault asked.

Vex’s hand shot out, not for me, but for the primer. His fingers closed around it, over mine.

The world exploded.

Not in fire and rock, but in consciousness.

A torrent of information, of *feeling*, blasted through the connection. I saw the mountain’s life, a slow, burning breath over millennia. I saw the careful, loving work of the Wardens who had woven the geothermal taps into a stable song. I felt the exquisite, fragile balance of pressures, temperatures, and flows that kept the caldera from tearing itself apart. It was a symphony, and Vex’s probes were a fist slamming down on the keys.

And I felt Vex. Not his thoughts, but the shape of his will. A brilliant, jagged, relentless spike of intention. A mind that saw the symphony as a code to be rewritten, the balance as an inefficiency to be corrected. To him, the sacred was just a system running on legacy hardware.

The clash was silent, total, and agonising. It was two incompatible truths trying to occupy the same space. The primer was the conduit. It vibrated between us, a thing in agony. The light from the aperture flickered wildly, strobing across the collapsing grove.

“Let… go…” he gritted out, his face a mask of strain.

“You… first…” The words were torn from me. The pressure was in my skull, in my soul. I felt the mountain’s pain as my own.

He pushed, not with his body, but with that spike of will. He tried to overwrite the primer’s resonance with his own, to make it a tool of violation. I didn’t push back. I did the only thing I could think of. I let go. Not of the primer, but of my self.

I stopped trying to be a wall. I became the thread.

I thought of the rain on the five-foot way. The smell of wet asphalt and frangipani. The weight of a suitcase the colour of a bruise. I thought of Kaela’s practical courage, of the silent Wardens, of the clean taste of spring water. I thought of the quiet power of a thing preserved, not because it is weak, but because it is precious. I offered it all into the stream, not as a weapon, but as a testament.

The primer’s song changed.

It softened. It deepened. It became the drum of the Singapore rain, the hum of the ancient stone, the beat of a heart that chooses to stand and wait, to understand, to protect.

Vex’s will met not resistance, but a profound, enveloping *context*. His spike of intention was not shattered; it was surrounded, drowned in the sheer, vast *is-ness* of what he was trying to break. His brilliant, narrow truth was shown to be a single, screeching note against the chord of a world.

He gasped. His eyes, locked on mine, widened. For a fleeting, eternal second, I saw not a monster, but a man—terrified, profoundly alone, staring into the mirror of his own insignificance. He saw the fire beyond the door, and for the first time, understood he was made of kindling.

His hand jerked back as if burned.

The connection broke.

The physical world crashed back in. The tremors. The roaring steam. The groaning trees.

Vex stumbled back, staring at his empty hand, then at me, his face bleached of all triumph, all mania. He looked hollow. Lost.

The aperture in the monolith began to pulse, the spiral of light contracting.

“It’s rejecting you,” I said, my voice raw. “The lock won’t hold much longer. The mountain is coming apart. Go. Now.”

He didn’t move. He just stared at the closing light, at the ruin he had authored.

A figure burst from the steam at the edge of the grove—Kaela, her jacket torn, a burn on her cheek, but her eyes fierce and clear. She took in the scene: the crevasse, the pulsing monolith, Vex standing broken, me holding the shining primer.

“Leo! The whole caldera rim is destabilising! We have maybe three minutes before this whole bowl cooks off!”

The primer was pulling me now, gently but insistently, toward the closing aperture. The song was a summons. The final verse.

I looked at Kaela. I looked at the broken earth. I looked at the light.

The vault wasn’t a prize to be won. It was a responsibility to be entered. The only way to reset the lock, to calm the mountain, was from inside. The template had to be witnessed, activated, by the key.

I had become the key.

“I have to go in,” I said.

Kaela understood instantly. She didn’t argue. She gave one sharp, agonised nod. “Reset the sequence. We’ll hold the door.”

*We*. She meant herself, and the mountain, and the ghosts of all the Wardens. She would stand in the frame.

I turned my back on Vex, on the crumbling world, and stepped toward the light.

Vex found his voice then, a shattered whisper. “What’s in there?”

I didn’t look back.

“The answer to the question you never knew how to ask.”

And I walked into the heart of the mountain.

The light enveloped me. It was not a tunnel, but an unfolding. The roar of the dying caldera faded into a profound, resonant silence. I stood in a space that was neither large nor small. The walls, the floor, the ceiling—they were all made of the same substance: a living, glowing crystal that pulsed with the same slow rhythm as the primer in my hand. In the centre of the space floated a single, complex shape, a three-dimensional mandala of interlocking gold and stone, turning slowly in the air. It was the template. The memory of balance.

I could feel the mountain’s distress through the crystal—the screeching feedback loops, the spiking pressures. The mandala’s turn was jagged, erratic.

The primer was silent now. Its job was done. It had delivered the custodian.

I reached out, not with my hand, but with the understanding it had forged in me. I touched the mandala with my mind.

The world did not explode.

It healed.

A wave of calm, precise instruction flowed out from the mandala, through the crystal, into the trembling geothermal veins. I felt valves of stone sigh shut. I felt flows of immense heat gently redirected. I felt fractures sigh closed. The mandala’s turn smoothed, becoming a slow, stately, eternal rotation. The pulse in the crystal walls steadied into a deep, restful beat.

The Apex was not a weapon. It was a tuning fork. And I had just struck the note that brought the mountain back into harmony.

Exhaustion, vast and absolute, washed over me. I sank to my knees on the crystal floor. The light was gentle now, nurturing. The mandala turned, its perfect geometry a comfort.

I had done it. I had saved the temple from the fire.

Then the crystal beneath me shivered. Not with instability, but with a new, *incoming* resonance. A different frequency. Hard, metallic, and hungry. It was faint, coming from very far away, but it was unmistakable. It was probing, searching, scraping against the edges of the harmony I had just restored.

It was looking for the note I had just struck.

The primer at my side gave one last, faint, warning thrum.

The Apex was secure.

But I had just shown the universe how to find it.

The crystal walls, for the first time, felt less like a sanctuary, and more like a lens, focusing a distant, attentive gaze directly on me.

I was no longer a pilgrim in a sacred space.

I was a beacon in the dark.

# Chapter 11

## **Chapter 11**

The silence after harmony is a different kind of sound. It is not an absence, but a fullness so complete it presses against the eardrums. I knelt on the crystal floor, the deep, restful pulse of the mountain moving through my bones. The mandala turned, a slow, golden clockwork of peace. I had done it. The fire was banked. The mountain’s great heart beat steadily, and I was a tiny, grateful creature resting against its ribs.

Then came the scrape.

It was not a sound you heard with your ears. It was a vibration in the teeth, a cold fingernail drawn down the spine of the world. It came from a distance so vast it should have been meaningless, a whisper from a dead star. But the crystal chamber was not a room; it was an ear. A lens. And it focused that whisper into a clear, metallic signal.

*Probe. Search. Scrape.*

It was a different frequency. The opposite of the harmony. Where the mountain’s song was fluid, geothermal, ancient, this was hard, machined, and hungry. It slid over the surface of the newly-restored calm, testing, tasting. Looking for a seam. Looking for the note I had just struck.

The primer on the floor beside me gave a final, dull thrum. A stone dropping into a deep well. A warning.

The peace curdled. The nurturing light in the crystal walls took on a new quality: exposure. I was no longer a custodian in a sanctuary. I was a lit match in a field of dry grass, seen from very, very far away.

I pushed myself up, my limbs leaden with a weariness that went beyond muscle. It was the fatigue of the spirit. The primer’s work had hollowed me out, and the act of tuning the mountain had filled that hollow with something too vast for my frame. I felt thin. Translucent. And through me, that distant, hungry signal pulsed.

I had to move. The thought was a dull instinct. The chamber had only one entrance: the narrow, crystalline passage I had ascended. I stumbled toward it, my hand leaving a damp print on the wall. The pulse of the mountain was a comfort, but beneath it, like a stain on clean water, the scraping persisted. It was learning. Mapping the edges of the harmony.

The descent was a blur of refracted light and trembling muscle. The crystal steps, once humming with potential, now felt like a ladder out of a grave. I emerged into the circular antechamber where the three arches stood. The murals seemed different. The depicted builders, with their tools and their serene faces, no longer looked like pioneers. They looked like sentries. Their eyes, in the flickering light from the central crystal plinth, seemed to track me.

The artifact was where I had left it, on the plinth. It was inert. Dull. Just a complex piece of carved stone. The connection I had felt to it, the living thread of understanding, was severed. It was a spent cartridge.

I picked it up. It was cold.

A low groan shuddered through the temple. Not the healing sigh of stone, but the protest of a great weight settling. Dust, fine as powdered bone, sifted from the ceiling high above. The global destabilization. I had healed the mountain’s core, but the damage was already done. The temple, this machine of balance, was coming apart.

I heard the shouts then, echoing up from the depths. Human voices, sharp with panic. Leo. Vex.

I shoved the artifact into my pack and ran, not up toward the jungle and the sky, but down, back into the temple’s wounded belly. The light-strips in the floor flickered, casting stuttering, nightmare shadows. The air grew hot and thick. The mountain’s new, steady rhythm was being fought by the chaos Vex had unleashed in the control vault.

***

The vault door was ajar, a sliver of hellish orange light bleeding into the corridor. The sound that poured out was a cacophony of shrieks—overloading systems, tearing metal, and a human voice riding the chaos like a jagged crest.

“—won’t have it! None of you will!”

Vex.

I slipped inside.

The vault was a vision of technological apocalypse. The central console, that beautiful, terrible tree of light and data, was a seizure of colour. Crimson alerts bloomed and died across every surface. The holographic orrery of the temple’s systems spun wildly, trajectories fraying into violent, spastic lines. The air smelled of ozone and burning plastic.

Vex stood before the main interface, her back to me. She was a silhouette against the storm of light, her hands raised like a conductor before a ruinous orchestra. She wasn’t trying to control it anymore. She was willing it to burn.

“You think your sacrifice matters?” she screamed at the console, at the ghosts in the machine, at Leo who was crouched behind a secondary terminal, his fingers flying across a smaller, intact touchpad. “It’s a footnote! This power doesn’t want custodians. It wants a wielder!”

“It’s not a weapon, Elara!” Leo’s voice was hoarse, stripped raw by the screaming systems. He didn’t look up. His entire being was poured into the screen before him. “It’s a balance. And you’ve cracked the scale.”

“I’ve *liberated* it!” She brought her fist down on a primary rune-node.

The effect was immediate. A sound like a dying giant filled the vault. A deep, structural *crack* reverberated through the floor. On the orrery, an entire branch of the temple’s schematic—the western geothermal vents—flared white and vanished. The floor lurched. A chunk of the ceiling, a decorative panel of copper and lapis, sheared free and crashed behind me.

The global destabilization wasn’t a theory anymore. It was in the room.

Vex turned, her face illuminated by the strobing console. Triumph and despair warred in her eyes. She saw me in the doorway. “Pilgrim! Come to witness the birth of a new age? Or to die in the old one?”

“You’re killing the mountain,” I said. My voice was quiet, almost absorbed by the din. It was just a fact.

“The mountain is a battery!” she spat. “And I am pulling the plug. If the world can’t have it, no one can.”

She raised her hand again, aiming for the central core of the console. A final, obliterating strike.

Leo moved. He came out from behind his terminal not with a tackle, but with a lunge, his body a desperate, unarmed barrier between her and the machine. He caught her wrist. They struggled, two figures etched in firelight, a pantomime of opposition against the backdrop of collapse.

Vex was stronger, fueled by a furious nihilism. She threw him off. Leo stumbled back, hitting the edge of the console. A new alarm, deeper and more urgent than all the others, began to pulse. A resonant, bone-shaking hum built in the walls.

**CRITICAL OVERLOAD. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IMMINENT.**

The translation shimmered in the air, a final, elegant epitaph.

Vex looked at the warning, then at her hand, then at the heart of the console. A strange calm settled over her. The debate was over. She had lost. So she would turn loss into annihilation.

She smiled. It was the most terrifying thing I had seen in the temple.

She slammed her palm, not onto a rune, but onto the smooth, glowing surface of the main power conduit.

The console did not explode. It *imploded*. Light was sucked inward from every screen, every hologram, every strip in the floor, converging on the point of her touch. There was a silent, breathless moment of absolute vacuum. Then it erupted.

The blast was not fire, but pure, concussive force. It threw Vex across the vault like a rag doll. It shattered the remaining screens. It blew the holographic orrery into a million dying stars. The vault door shrieked on its hinges and slammed shut, sealing us in.

The lights died. All of them.

For three heartbeats, there was only blackness and the ringing in my ears. Then, emergency luminescence, a faint, fungal green, seeped from cracks in the walls. It illuminated a scene of wreckage.

The console was a blackened skeleton. Vex lay in a heap against the far wall, not moving. Dust and smoke swirled in the green gloom.

Leo pushed himself up from where the blast had flung him, near my feet. He was bleeding from a cut on his temple. His glasses were gone. His eyes, when they found mine, were wide with a terrible clarity.

“The manual reset,” he coughed, the words gritty with dust. “The failsafe. It’s the only thing left.”

He staggered to the ruined console. In the centre of the devastation, one small panel still glowed with a soft, persistent blue. A single, physical lever, carved from a dark, non-conductive stone, was housed there. Unharmed.

“The builders knew,” he said, his fingers tracing the lever’s housing. “They knew a custodian might face this. A total corruption of the system.” He looked at me, and in the green light, he looked ancient. “The primer. Did it… show you? The third vault wasn’t about power. It was about sacrifice.”

The memory rose in me, not from the primer, but from the touch of the mandala. The final, clarifying truth. The lock was not just sealed by knowledge. It was sealed by choice.

“It requires a channel,” I said, the understanding dawning with a cold, absolute weight. “A living conduit to carry the reset command back into the mountain’s core. To bypass the wreckage.”

Leo nodded. He placed his hand on the stone lever. “The artifact. It’s the key. But the key needs a turn. A… life force. To bridge the gap between intention and action.” He gave me a ghost of his old, wry smile. “Physics of the spirit, Lia. Every action requires an equal and opposite reaction. To stop this,” he gestured at the crumbling vault, “requires a push. A final one.”

He was not asking for permission. He was stating a fact. The vision from the mural in the third vault crystallized: the builder, not wiring the final connection, but *becoming* it, his essence flowing into the crystal, sealing the lock with his own silence.

“No.” The word was out before I could think. “There has to be another way.”

“The way *is* the other way,” he said, his voice gentle. “The selfish way is Vex’s way. Burn it all. The selfless way… is this. It’s not destruction. It’s a redirect. A closing of the circuit.” He looked at the lever. “The primer chose you for the tune. It chose me for the turn. I understand the systems. I can be the channel.”

Another tremor, stronger than any before, rocked the vault. A great slab of the ceiling buckled. The sound from beyond the door was a roar—the mountain itself, beginning to tear apart at the seams.

“Give me the artifact,” he said.

It was not a command. It was a request. The last one he would ever make.

I pulled it from my pack. It was still cold, dead stone. I placed it in his hands. Our fingers brushed. His were trembling.

He positioned the artifact on a specific indentation before the lever. It fit perfectly. As it settled, a faint thread of blue light travelled from the stone lever, through the artifact, and into Leo’s waiting hands. He gasped, a short, sharp intake of breath. The light climbed his arms, etching his veins in sapphire.

“It’s okay,” he whispered, to me, or to himself, or to the mountain. “It’s just a door.”

He closed his eyes. And he pulled the lever.

The world did not explode.

It *unmade*.

The blue light did not flare. It consumed. It poured from the artifact, up Leo’s arms, flooding his torso, his neck, his face. He became a statue of living cerulean glass. He did not scream. His mouth opened in a silent, profound *Oh* of understanding.

And I saw it. Through him. Through the channel of his dissolving life.

***

*I am not Leo. I am one of Many. We stand in a chamber of pure, singing crystal. It is not yet a temple. It is a birth. The mountain’s heart is wild, a newborn star of geothermal rage. We have built the lock. We have crafted the Apex. But the final connection is unstable. The system rejects the inert seal. It requires a pulse. A conscious, willing pulse to initiate the eternal rhythm.*

*“The lock is a mind,” the First Builder says, her voice the sound of wind over a flute. “It needs a first thought. A thought of peace, to quiet the fire.”*

*“A thought is a life,” another says.*

*“Yes.”*

*There is no debate. Only a slow, serene looking-around. We see each other. We have walked the three paths: the path of stone, the path of leaf, the path of breath. We understand the cost of balance.*

*I step forward. Not because I am braver. But because in this moment, I am the most ready. My understanding is complete. I feel no fear. Only a vast, impending clarity.*

*I place my hands on the core. I do not wire it. I open myself to it. I let my consciousness, my individual spark, flow into the circuits of stone and light. I think not of control, but of lullaby. I think of the deep, slow breath after tears. I think of silence after a storm.*

*My body grows cold. The light of my life becomes the first steady pulse in the crystal. The wild heart of the mountain feels it. And begins to slow. To match. To harmonize.*

*The others are weeping. But they are also singing. A single, low note that carries my essence into the foundations of the world.*

*I am not gone. I am the first beat. The founding note.*

*I am the seal.*

***

The vision shattered.

Leo was on his knees before the console. The brilliant blue light was retracting, flowing back from his body, through the artifact, and into the lever. But it was taking something with it. The colour drained from his face, from his hair, from his clothes. He was becoming monochrome. A photograph fading.

The artifact was no longer inert. It glowed with a soft, internal radiance. It was fused to the console, the stone of the lever flowing over it like wax, binding them together.

The shuddering of the mountain ceased. The roar of collapse softened to a rumble, then to a sigh. The violent, spiking lines on the one remaining flickering screen smoothed into gentle, rolling waves. A single, steady pulse, deep and green, began to glow from the core of the ruined console.

*Reset Complete. System Stabilizing.*

The translation hung in the smoky air.

The cost hung heavier.

Leo slumped forward. I caught him before he hit the floor. He was light, impossibly light, as if the essence of him had been hollowed out. His skin was cool. His eyes fluttered open. They were Leo’s eyes, but the light behind them was distant, guttering.

“See?” he breathed, the sound a rustle of dry leaves. “Physics.”

A groan came from across the vault. Vex stirred. She pushed herself up on one elbow, her body broken, her eyes finding the stabilized console, the fused artifact, Leo dying in my arms. She understood. Her face, for a fleeting second, was not triumphant or despairing. It was empty. She had aimed for godhood or oblivion. She had been granted neither. She had been rendered irrelevant.

With a final, grinding shriek, the section of ceiling above her gave way. Tons of carved stone and earth buried her without a sound. The vault fell quiet, save for the new, steady, green pulse.

Leo’s hand found mine. His fingers had no strength.

“The beacon,” he whispered, his gaze drifting toward the ceiling, as if he could see through it to the crystal chamber far above. “You’re lit now. They’ll come.”

“Who?” I asked, my throat tight.

“The ones who scrape.” He coughed, a dry, soundless thing. “The hungry ones. The primer’s last gift… is a warning. The harmony… attracts them. You struck the note. They’ll follow it.”

His eyes fixed on mine, holding onto my sight like an anchor. “Don’t let them… tune it to their song.”

His breath left him. Not with a gasp, but with a slow, deliberate release. A final exhalation that seemed to merge with the steady pulse of the mountain. The light in his eyes did not go out; it simply receded, joining a deeper, older rhythm.

I held him as the green light pulsed. On. Off. On. Off.

A heartbeat that was not his.

The vault was a tomb. For Vex. For Leo. For the dream of simple discovery. The air was clearing, the dust settling. The mountain was saved. The world above would never know how close it had come to fire, or what that salvation cost.

I laid Leo down. I stood. My body ached. My spirit was a numb, cold thing.

I looked at the console. The artifact—the key, the tuner, the catalyst for sacrifice—was now part of the machine. A monument to a choice. It glowed with a faint, persistent light, the same green as the stabilizing pulse.

Leo’s final words hung in the silence.

*You’re lit now.*

I looked at my hands. They were just hands. They had packed a suitcase in the rain. They had touched a crystal mandala and healed a mountain. They had held a man as he turned himself into a doorway and closed it behind him.

I was not a pilgrim anymore. I was not a custodian.

I was a beacon. And in the vast, listening dark, a hard, metallic, hungry note was already echoing, searching for its counterpart. It was following the trail of a healed mountain, a restored harmony.

It was following the sound of me.

I turned from the dead and the sealed lock. I walked to the great vault door. It opened to my touch, smooth and silent. The corridor beyond was dark, but stable. The temple held its breath.

I began the long walk up, toward the jungle, toward the sky, toward a world that thought it was ordinary. The artifact was gone, fused into silence. But the note it had helped me strike was still ringing out, a perfect, clear frequency in the cosmos.

And I was the only one left who could hear the answering scrape, growing slowly, inexorably, nearer.

## **Chapter 32: The Five-Foot Way**

The rain in Singapore is a forgiving thing. It doesn’t arrive as a wall, but as a veil, a soft grey sigh that blurs the edges of the towers and turns the city into a watercolour. I stood under the five-foot way of the shophouse, the covered walkway that was neither street nor shop, a space for return. The air smelled of wet asphalt, *kopi*, and the faint, enduring sweetness of frangipani from the tree that had, against all odds, cracked its concrete pot and flourished. My suitcase, the same small, hard-shelled thing the colour of a bruise, was dry. I was waiting for the rain to ease, not for a break in the weather, but for the right moment to step back into the world I had left behind.

It had taken months to walk out of that mountain.

Not in body. My body had emerged from the Temple of Echoes after three days, guided by a silent, green-lit path, dehydrated and scratched, my clothes stiff with dust and dried salt from tears I hadn’t felt fall. The Chronos Guard had scattered like insects under a lifted stone, their purpose extinguished with Vex’s death and the mountain’s silent, definitive hum. The authorities found a confused geologist and a sealed archaeological site showing minor, non-threatening thermal activity. They filed it under “unexplained natural event.” They did not file Leo.

I brought him out wrapped in a thermal blanket from his own pack. He was light. The green pulse in the mountain had preserved him, a gentle embalming. In Jakarta, I used the last of Thorne’s obscure contacts, a woman who asked no questions and understood the sanctity of quiet passage. He was cremated. His ashes now rested in two places: half interred in a quiet corner of the Bogor Botanical Gardens, near the great banyan tree he’d loved; the other half I had carried with me, in a small, plain urn of polished river stone.

The mountain was saved. The world was ordinary. And I was a beacon in that ordinary world, listening to a frequency no one else could hear. Leo’s last truth was my new reality: I was lit. The artifact was gone, fused into the mountain’s heart, a permanent tuning fork struck once. But the note it had helped me sound—the note of my own spirit, clarified through sacrifice and connection—was still ringing. And in the vastness, something had begun to echo back. Not the scraping, metallic hunger I’d first sensed, but something else. A presence. A curiosity. A distant, resonant acknowledgement. It didn’t frighten me anymore. It was a thread in the tapestry, a proof of connection. My seeking had become a signal.

* * *

**Scene 1: The Unseen Recovery**

The recovery was not of the body, but of the story.

In Singapore, the museum was as I’d left it: cool, hushed, a secular cathedral to forgotten time. Dr. Saito met me in the Southeast Asian ceramics gallery. Her sharp eyes took me in—the new stillness, the weight in the shoulders that was not fatigue but ballast.

“Kaela,” she said, her voice softer than I remembered. “Your sabbatical report was… sparse.”

“Some things don’t fit in the fields,” I said. “Purpose of Travel: Spiritual Inquiry. Findings: Inconclusive, yet transformative.”

She nodded, as if she’d expected this. “And Leo Thorne?”

“He won’t be returning.”

A long silence, filled with the mute history of a thousand glazed pots. “His father’s research?”

“It will be published. Co-authored by myself and the estate of Leo Thorne. We’re framing it as a speculative historical thesis with anthropological commentary. The Echo civilization as a case study in the spiritual costs of technological transcendence.”

“A warning for the ages,” she murmured, quoting my draft abstract.

“Yes.”

She studied a Ming dynasty vase, its blue patterns swirling like captured smoke. “The board will call it fringe. Unsubstantiated.”

“Let them. Truth has a weight, even without evidence. It changes the one who carries it. That has to be enough.”

She turned to me, and in her gaze, I saw not a director assessing an employee, but a fellow seeker recognizing a milestone. “Your position is here, whenever you wish. But your title… perhaps it should change. From ‘Archival Researcher’ to ‘Consultant in Resonant Histories.’” A faint smile. “The pay is the same. The purview is… wider.”

It was a gift. A space for waiting, of a different kind. I accepted.

* * *

**Scene 2: The Archivist’s New Codex**

Leo’s old desk in the archives was cleared. His ghost was not there; it was in the mountain, in the green pulse, in the smell of ozone and soil. I did not sit there. Instead, I worked from the reading room, assembling the Thorne Codex.

It was more than a paper. It was a testament. We wove together Elias Thorne’s feverish data, Leo’s lyrical field notes, and my own clinical observations of the temple’s psycho-acoustic effects. We presented the Echo not as a lost city, but as a lost philosophy: a culture that heard the fundamental frequency of the planet and, in trying to manipulate it, learned that true harmony required sacrifice, not control. Their extinction was not a tragedy, but a chosen silence—a return of the note to the source.

The day it was accepted by a small but respected journal of archaeological theory, I took the stone urn to the Gardens. It was late afternoon, the light dappled. I poured his ashes at the base of the banyan, its aerial roots forming a temple of living wood.

“You were right, Leo,” I said to the quiet air. “It wasn’t about rewriting the score. It was about learning to listen to the silence between the notes. That’s where the meaning is.”

A breeze moved through the canopy, a sound like a deep, approving breath. The hungry, scraping note in my mind seemed to recede further, soothed by this act of rightful return. The new signal—the curious, resonant acknowledgement—pulsed, soft and clear. A greeting.

* * *

**Scene 3: The Restoration**

The publication caused a minor, academic ripple. “A romantic, if unprovable, allegory,” one critic wrote. “A powerful mythopoetic framework for contemporary ecological anxiety,” praised another.

But for a few, it was a key. Researchers studying unexplained sonic phenomena in other ancient sites wrote to me. A physicist working on quantum resonance sent a thoughtful, speculative email. The legacy of the Thornes, once a stain of madness, was now a respected, if unorthodox, branch of inquiry. Elias was restored. Leo was vindicated.

Vex’s legacy evaporated. The Chronos Guard was a phantom, its assets seized, its name a footnote in conspiracy forums. The world, obsessed with its visible crises, had no room for a secret war over a mountain’s heartbeat. The victory was invisible. The peace was profound.

And I, the beacon, lived with the signal. I learned to meditate not to empty my mind, but to tune it. The returning pulse was not an invasion; it was a conversation across a distance I could not fathom. My spiritual seeking had begun with a desire to fix a broken past. It had ended—or rather, transformed—into the act of holding a connection to a vast, living present. I sought nothing now. I attended. I witnessed.

* * *

**Scene 4: The Space for No Longer Waiting**

Tonight, the rain is gentle.

Kaela meets me under the five-foot way. She carries no umbrella. Her hair is beaded with moisture, her face calm. She has flown in from Yogyakarta, where she is advising on the seismic stability of a temple complex. She, too, is a consultant now. We are both translators between worlds.

“You’re late,” I say, no edge in it.

“The rain,” she says, nodding at the shimmering street. “It makes the city slow down. Makes you pay attention.”

We walk to a nearby hawker centre, the air thick with the symphony of sizzling woks and murmured conversation. We eat *hokkien mee* at a plastic table, the steam mingling with the humid night. We talk of ordinary things: museum politics, geothermal quirks, a new book. The unspeakable sits between us, a comfortable, shared silence.

Afterwards, we take a taxi to the top of Faber Peak. The rain has stopped. The city is laid out below us, a galaxy of human light, and beyond it, the dark, sleeping curve of the sea.

“Is it still there?” she asks quietly, looking at the stars. “The… echo?”

I close my eyes. In my mind, the green pulse of the mountain is a steady, distant thrum. And beyond it, fainter but unmistakable, is the new signal—a complex, beautiful chord, listening back. “It’s not an echo anymore. It’s a call. And a response.”

She takes my hand. Her palm is warm, real, grounded. “Do you know what it wants?”

“I don’t think ‘want’ is the right word. It’s not Vex’s hunger. It’s… recognition. Like meeting eyes across a crowded room. It knows I can hear. And I know it’s there. That’s the connection. That’s the purpose.”

“To be a witness,” she says.

“To be a bridge,” I correct softly. “A five-foot way between one reality and another.”

We stand in silence as the city lights twinkle, a terrestrial mirror of the stars above. The frantic seeking is over. The pilgrimage is complete. I had left this island looking for a cure in the past, a way to silence a scream. I returned having found a voice in the present—my own—and having used it to sing a mountain back to sleep, and in doing so, to sing a note that reached the cosmos.

My suitcase, the colour of a fading bruise, sits by my feet. It is no longer a vessel for escape, but for carrying small, essential things: a change of clothes, a notebook, a stone urn now empty. It is a tool for a journey, not the journey itself.

The spiritual seeking had led me to a terrifying, beautiful truth: you do not find the connection by chasing it. You find it by becoming still enough, clear enough, that the connection can find you. You become the still point in the turning world, the listening ear in the noise. You become, as Leo said, lit.

Kaela leans her head on my shoulder. The last of the clouds part, and a single, bright star seems to pulse, just once, in time with the quiet green rhythm in my soul.

I am not waiting for a break in the rain anymore. I am standing in the space between, covered but open, part of the street and part of the shelter, hearing the whole world’s drumming, beautiful song. And for the first time since I stood here a lifetime ago, suitcase in hand, heart in tatters, I am not waiting for anything at all.

I am home. And I am answered.

# Chapter 13

## **Chapter 13**

The peace of the answered is a delicate ecology. It is not an absence of sound, but a new arrangement of it. The frantic, searching static of my mind had resolved into a single, clear tone—the green note of the mountain, the cosmic call—and around it, the ordinary noises of my life now arranged themselves like respectful attendants. The hiss of the kettle in Kaela’s shophouse kitchen was a white-noise halo. The distant, predawn groan of a garbage truck was a bass pedal. The soft, papery rustle as I turned a page in my notebook was the brush of a snare. I was the still point, and the world turned around me, musical.

For three days, I simply existed within it. I slept deeply, dreamlessly, in the spare room that smelled of teak and lemongrass detergent. I ate the food Kaela put in front of me: *kaya* toast with slabs of cold butter, brothy *bak kut teh*, spicy *laksa* that made my scalp prickle. We talked, but not of Vex, or the mountain, or the call. We talked of her work restoring a Peranakan tile mural in Katong, of the stubborn mould in her bathroom grouting, of a new coffee place in Everton Park that roasted its beans with gula melaka. It was the mundane liturgy of a shared life, and I participated with a reverence I had never before possessed. This, too, was part of the song.

My suitcase, the colour of a fading bruise, remained unpacked by the bed. It was no longer a symbol of flight, but its continued presence was a question. A tool for a journey, I had thought. But what journey begins once you have arrived?

On the fourth morning, the note changed.

It was not a shift in pitch, but in texture. A faint granularity, like dust motes swirling in a sunbeam, appeared at the edges of the pure tone. It was the aural equivalent of a lens focusing, bringing something distant into a soft, insistent clarity. It wasn’t a new sound. It was a layer of the existing one, now discernible. A harmonic, previously buried.

I was sitting at the wrought-iron table on Kaela’s tiny back *kawasan*, a pocket of space just large enough for two chairs and a struggling fiddle-leaf fig. The air was thick, pre-rain, the sky a uniform pale grey. I had my notebook open, not writing, just letting the morning press against my skin.

The granular hum intensified. It pulled, not from the sky or the city, but from the ground. From the direction of the city centre, from under the weight of marble and finance and history.

The National Museum. Where it had all begun. Where the shard of the Singa’s skull had hummed to me from its glass case, the first broken piece of the tune.

Auntie Li’s voice, from a lifetime ago, echoed in the new silence of my mind: *Some things are not meant to be found. They are meant to find you, when you are ready to be found by them.*

The shard had found me. The mountain had found me. This… this was different. This was the note, *my* note, now finding something else. An echo from a place I had already been.

I went inside. Kaela was at her drafting table, a magnifying lamp throwing a pool of intense light onto a fragmented ceramic plate she was piecing together. Her hands were steady, a dot of glue poised on the tip of a fine probe.

“It’s pulling me,” I said, my voice quiet in the still room.

She didn’t look up, her concentration absolute. “The call?”

“A part of it. It’s coming from the museum.”

Her hand completed its motion, adhering a tiny fragment with microscopic precision. She exhaled, set the probe down, and finally turned. Her eyes were sharp, assessing. Not worried. Curious. “A response to your response.”

“I think so. Like a conversation finding its thread.”

“Will you go?”

“I have to.”

She nodded, as if I’d confirmed the time. “Take an umbrella. The sky is full of waiting.”

***

The museum in the daytime was a different organism. Before, I had moved through its climate-controlled halls like a ghost in a tomb, drawn by a private, painful frequency. Now, I moved as a pilgrim. The grand rotunda, with its stained-glass dome, was flooded with the diffuse grey light from the skywells. Schoolchildren in matching polo shirts streamed like colourful rivulets around the static islands of artefacts, their voices a high-pitched chatter that bounced off the marble. Tourists stood with audio guides pressed to their ears, listening to sanctioned histories.

I bypassed the Singapore History gallery. The pull was not from the Singa’s shard. It was deeper, lower in the building. Towards the foundations.

The granular hum led me down a staircase, past a “Staff Only” sign I ignored with a calm certainty, and into a corridor of plain white walls and linoleum floor. The air grew cooler, drier. This was the belly of the beast, the archival space where the past was not displayed, but stored. The door at the end of the corridor was unmarked, but unlocked.

The room was a conservator’s laboratory. Long tables were lined with strange, silent machinery: spectral imaging cameras, suction mounts, trays of surgical tools. Shelves held boxes labelled with accession numbers. The air smelled of ozone, stale paper, and the faint, metallic tang of old ink.

And in the centre of the room, on a table under a bank of LED lights, was a boat.

Not a model. A fragment of a real one, about eight feet long, a curved, blackened rib of ancient timber. It was charred, waterlogged, its surface a cracked landscape of extreme age. It was being prepared for some kind of analysis, probes and wires taped to its hull like medical sensors on a sleeping giant.

The granular hum wasn’t just coming from it. It *was* it. The green note in my soul vibrated in perfect, resonant sympathy with this piece of silent, burned wood.

A man in a white lab coat and blue nitrile gloves was bent over the stern section, a tablet in his hand. He was young, Chinese, with a focused stillness I recognised. He felt my presence and straightened, his eyes widening slightly behind his glasses.

“This area is restricted,” he said, not unkindly, but with firm institutional authority.

“I know,” I said. My voice was steady, tuned to the same frequency as the boat. “What is it?”

He blinked, thrown by the directness. A lifetime of academia warred with something else—the instinct of a fellow obsessive. “It’s a recent find. From a salvage operation in the Kallang Basin. They were dredging for the new drainage project and brought this up. Carbon dating places it… well, it’s anomalous. Earlier than it should be, given the site’s known history.”

“It’s burned.”
“Catastrophically. A fire at sea, we think. Or a ritual burning.”
“Can I touch it?”
“Absolutely not.” He took a step closer to the artefact, a protective gesture. “The salts from your skin, the oils… it’s incredibly fragile. It’s been under freshwater silt for centuries. It’s only stable in this controlled environment.”

I didn’t move closer. I didn’t need to. The connection was not physical. I closed my eyes, just for a second, and let the green note in me swell, not to sing, but to listen.

The granular hum from the boat resolved. It wasn’t a single tone, but a chorus of tiny, final moments. The scream of rending wood. The roar of hungry flame. The hiss of water meeting fire. And underneath it all, a deeper, more terrible sound: a profound, resonant *snap*, like the heartstring of the world breaking.

My eyes flew open. The conservator was staring at me, his professional detachment replaced by naked fascination.

“You hear it, too,” he said. It wasn’t a question.

I looked at him, really looked. He wasn’t just a technician. His posture, the intensity in his eyes… he was a listener. “What do you hear?”

He glanced at the door, then back at me, deciding. He set his tablet down. “Static. On certain radio bands. A… a patterned interference when we try to take certain spectral images. The equipment malfunctions. And sometimes… sometimes I think I hear singing. Very faint. Like a memory of singing.” He gave a short, self-conscious laugh. “You’re going to think I’m mad.”

“No,” I said. “I don’t. My name is Eli.”

“Dr. Arjun Shah,” he said, automatically, then waved the title away. “Arjun. I’m the lead conservator on this project. We call it the *Naga’s Rib*.”

“Why?”

“Because of the location. And the burn pattern. Local folklore, the kind they don’t put in the school textbooks, talks about a great water *naga*, a serpent-dragon, that guarded the entrance to the old harbour. The story says a fleet of arrogant foreign ships tried to force the passage, armed with fire. They wounded the *naga*, and in its death-throes, it wrapped itself around the lead ship and dragged it down, burning, into the mud. A myth, obviously. A just-so story for a maritime disaster.”

I looked at the blackened timber. The note within it was a fossilised scream of fire and drowning. “What if it wasn’t a *naga*?”

He followed my gaze. “What else could it be?”

I didn’t answer. I was thinking of the Singa, the stone lion of the mountain. A land guardian. Why not a water guardian? A protector whose domain was the chaotic, vital space where the river met the sea, where the island ended and the world began. A different kind of threshold spirit.

“You said the dating was anomalous,” I said. “How anomalous?”

He chewed his lip. “Preliminary results suggest late 14th century. Which is impossible for that site. The major settlement was at the mouth of the Singapore River. Kallang was mangrove and fishing villages. There’s no record of a vessel of this size, or this… this catastrophic an event.”

“Unless the record was swallowed,” I said softly. “By mud. And by a story that became a myth.”

Arjun was silent for a long moment. The hum between the boat and my soul was a tangible thing in the sterile air. “Why are you here?” he finally asked. “Really.”

“I think your *Naga’s Rib* is calling for a witness. And I’ve recently become qualified.”

I told him. Not everything, but enough. The shard. The mountain. The green note. The call from the stars. I spoke in a low, measured tone, matching the rhythm of the laboratory’s hidden hum. He listened without interruption, his scientist’s skepticism overridden by the evidence of his own ears and the uncanny certainty in mine.

When I finished, he walked to a cabinet, unlocked it, and pulled out a small archival box. He brought it to the table next to the boat, but not too close. He lifted the lid. Inside, nestled in custom-cut grey foam, were a dozen objects recovered from the silt around the wreck. Mostly corroded metal: a few coins, a buckle, a knife blade. And one thing that was not metal.

It was a whistle. Carved from a dense, dark bone that was not ivory. It was short, simple, shaped like a hollowed-out seed. It was unburned.

“This was found near the stern,” Arjun said, his voice hushed. “It’s made of whale bone, we think. Or something like it. It’s the only organic object from the site that isn’t charcoal.”

The moment I saw it, the granular hum from the boat focused into a sharp, piercing point. The chorus of fire and snapping timber faded, and from the whistle emanated a single, clear, desperate note. A note meant to be blown. A summoning. Or a warning.

“It’s a calling-piece,” I breathed. “For the guardian. For the *naga*, or whatever it was.”

“It was never used,” Arjun said. “Or it was used too late.”

I understood. The catastrophic *snap* in the boat’s song. The guardian had been killed. Severed. Its connection to the place broken in violence and fire. The whistle was the un-uttered cry for help, the unanswered prayer, fossilised in silt and time.

My green note trembled in resonance with it. I had sung a mountain back to sleep. I had answered a cosmic call. And now I was being shown a wound—a severed connection in the spiritual ecology of the island itself. A hole in the song where a protector’s voice should be.

“It’s not just calling for a witness,” I said, the truth dawning with a cold, heavy clarity. “It’s calling for a repair.”

Arjun stared at the bone whistle. “How does one repair a myth?”

“You don’t repair the myth,” I said, my eyes on the blackened rib of the ship. “You repair the silence.”

***

I left the museum as the promised rain began, a fine, persistent drizzle that turned the afternoon into a watercolour wash. The green note in me was no longer a pure, peaceful tone. It was now a channel, and through it flowed the desperate, silent scream of the bone whistle and the agonised chorus of the *Naga’s Rib*. The answered peace was gone, replaced by a quiet, urgent responsibility.

Kaela was waiting when I returned, two cups of steaming *teh tarik* on the table. She took one look at my face and said, “The journey.”

I nodded, sinking into a chair. The warmth of the glass was a minor anchor. “It’s a wound. An old, deep one. In the water. A guardian was killed. Its… its frequency was severed.”

I told her of Arjun, the boat, the whistle. She listened, her face a mask of calm concentration, but her eyes were stormy.

“A bridge between realities,” she murmured, echoing my words from the rooftop. “And now you feel you must bridge a broken past.”

“It’s not a feeling. It’s a direct line. The call I answered… it’s tuned me to these frequencies. I can hear the break. The silence where there should be a song is louder than any noise.” I looked at my hands. “I sang a mountain to sleep. Can I… sing a connection back to life?”

“That is a different kind of magic,” she said. “That is not lullaby. That is resurrection.”

The word hung in the humid air, too large, too theological. “Not resurrection. Maybe… a grafting. A way to let the old pattern resonate again through a new string.”

“And where would you find this new string, Eli?”

I had no answer. The rain tapped its endless code against the window. The pull was no longer towards a location, but towards an action. And I had no score, no libretto for this work.

Later, in the deep indigo of evening, my phone lit up with a number I didn’t recognise. The text message was brief.

*Eli. Arjun. I’ve been reviewing the sonar maps of the dredge site. There’s an anomaly. A density mismatch in the silt, about fifty metres from where the Rib was found. Shape is… organic. Elongated. They’re going back in two days to investigate. If you want to see, be at the Marina East gate, 6 AM. No guarantees. -A*

I read the message three times. An organic shape. Elongated.

The *naga* itself.

Not a myth. A corpse.

The hook was not in my mind anymore. It was in my soul, sharp and undeniable. The journey was no longer metaphorical. It was a specific time, a specific gate, a specific descent into the wet, dark past. The spiritual seeking had ended on the rooftop. This was something else. This was spiritual surgery.

I looked out at the night, at the city lights reflected in a million raindrops on the glass. I was not waiting for a break in the rain anymore. I was preparing to walk into the heart of the storm, into the mud where history and myth had bled together, to listen to the oldest silence of all.

I am home. And I am answered.

And the answer is a summons to the depths.

# Chapter 14

## **Chapter 14**

The rain at dawn was not a wall. It was a veil, a fine, persistent gauze that turned the sodium lights of Marina East into smeared halos. It was the kind of rain that didn’t drum; it hissed, a steady exhalation from the concrete and the sea. I stood at the service gate, a utilitarian slash in a high fence, the colour of tired algae. My clothes were wrong—jeans, a thin cotton shirt, shoes meant for pavement, not for mud. The bruise-coloured suitcase was back in the shophouse. All I carried was a small waterproof pouch, inside it my phone, a notebook warped from the humidity, and the smooth, cold weight of the river stone from the *Rib*. A talisman, or a witness.

Arjun was already there, a silhouette against the grey bloom of the sea. He was talking to a man in high-visibility orange, the plastic of his raincoat cracking with every small movement. When he saw me, he gave a short, sharp nod. No smile. This was not a place for social punctuation.

“Eli. This is Pak Hassan. Site foreman.”

Pak Hassan looked me over, his eyes settling on my shoes. A faint, almost imperceptible sigh escaped him, a puff of steam in the damp air. “You stay where I say. You move when I say. You look where I point. The mud, it does not care about your curiosity. It only cares about weight. And it is hungry.”

His voice was gravel wrapped in silk, a voice that had commanded machines over the shriek of wind and tide for thirty years. I nodded. The hook in my soul twisted, a cold barb.

We passed through the gate. The world changed. The orderly geometry of the city—the lines of the park, the curves of the bayfront—fell away. Here was a raw, provisional landscape. The dredge site was a vast, water-filled wound in the coastline, cordoned off by temporary sheet-piling that rose from the water like the rusted teeth of a sunken leviathan. Within it, the sea was the colour of clay, agitated and opaque. A crane stood sentinel, its yellow paint a violent shout against the monochrome sky. A barge, low in the water, was tethered nearby, and on it sat a machine that looked like a mechanical nightmare of claws and hydraulic joints—a clamshell grab.

The air smelled of diesel, of saline rot, of the profound, iron tang of disturbed earth.

“The anomaly is there,” Arjun said, pointing to a spot about fifty metres from the barge. A cluster of red buoys bobbed in the murk. “The sonar ping was… unusual. Hard edges. A consistent density. Not rock. Not modern debris. Too straight for nature, too irregular for a pilon.”

“A bone,” I said. The word was a stone dropped into the well of the morning.

“Maybe. If bones were twenty metres long.” He glanced at Pak Hassan, who was speaking into a radio. “They will use the grab first. To clear the overburden. The silt layer is about four metres deep at that point. Then, if they see something, they will send divers. Visibility is zero. It will be by touch only.”

The rain hissed. The crane’s engine coughed, then settled into a deep, bronchial idle. The hook in my chest was a physical pull now, a line running from my sternum down into that specific patch of troubled water. *The oldest silence of all*. I had come to listen. But this place was not silent. It was a cacophony of industry, a roar meant to suppress the whispers of the deep. I closed my eyes for a second, trying to tune past the diesel thunder, to the frequency beneath. I heard nothing but the blood in my own ears, the hollow ringing that had been with me since London. The lullaby was gone. This was the anti-lullaby.

Pak Hassan barked a command. The crane operator, a tiny figure in his high cab, acknowledged with a wave. The machinery began to sing its own brutal opera. Chains clanked. The clamshell grab, its jaws wide like a titanic, steel scallop, was lifted from the barge deck. It swung out over the water, a pendulum of calculated force, and hung for a moment over the red buoys. Then it was released. It fell with a sound that was not a splash but a *gulp*, a deep, swallowing noise as the water parted and then closed over it.

We watched the cables tighten, vibrating. The crane groaned. The grab was digging, its jaws scouring the seabed, filling its maw with centuries of accumulated silt and memory. Minutes passed, marked only by the strain of the engine and the patter of rain on my shoulders. The crane lifted. The grab emerged from the water, streaming thick, grey liquid, a slurry of time and decay. It swung over to a designated dump area on the barge and opened. A ton of primordial ooze slid out with a wet, sighing collapse.

They repeated the process. Again. And again. Each bite was a violation, an excavation of a sealed layer. Each dump revealed nothing but uniform, slick mud. The romantic notion—that one grab would emerge cradling a sacred, curved ivory tusk—evaporated. This was archaeology by bludgeon. This was turning a sacred page with a shovel.

After the seventh load, Arjun shifted beside me. “It could be deeper. Or the sonar could be wrong. A ghost in the machine.”

Pak Hassan lit a cigarette, cupping his hand against the drizzle. His face was impassive. “The machine is not wrong. The ground is shy.”

On the ninth lift, something changed. The grab came up, but it did not swing immediately to the barge. It hung, dripping, over the water. From the crane cab, a sharp whistle cut the air. Pak Hassan dropped his cigarette, stamped it into the mud, and raised his radio.

“*Apa?*”

The radio crackled. The operator’s voice was tinny with excitement. “*Bukan lumpur. Ada kayu.*”

Not mud. There is wood.

Arjun’s breath caught. My hand went to the pouch at my side, fingers finding the river stone. *Wood*. Not bone. A different kind of relic.

“Tell him to set it down gently! On the barge!” Arjun said, his academic calm fracturing.

Pak Hassan relayed the command. The grab, moving with a new, deliberate care, traversed the short gap and lowered its cargo onto the steel deck. We moved as one, sloshing through the churned mud to the barge’s edge, scrambling up a slippery ladder.

The grab had opened. Spilling from it was not a clean, carved timber, but a blackened, twisted mass, encased in a shell of hardened silt. It was about the size of a small canoe, but grotesquely misshapen, like something that had been melted and then petrified. It smelled of peat and salt and a profound, cellular age.

“Teak,” Pak Hassan said, kneeling beside it. He scraped a patch with his knife. A hint of rich, deep brown showed through the black. “Old. Very old.”

“It’s not a ship’s plank,” Arjun murmured, circling it. “The curve is wrong. Too acute. And the thickness…” He looked at me, his eyes alight. “It’s a rib. A *structural* rib. But not from a boat.”

*The Rib*. The capitalisation was automatic in my mind. This was not *a* rib. This was another one. A sibling to the artifact in the climate-controlled lab. The hook in my soul vibrated, a plucked string. The silence was breaking, not with a song, but with the groan of tortured wood.

“There will be more,” I said, my voice strange to my own ears. “It’s not a lone piece. It’s part of a…”

I didn’t finish. The crane whistle blew again, two short, urgent blasts.

We turned. The grab had gone in for another bite, adjacent to the first. It was emerging now. And it was not coming up empty. Entangled in its steel jaws, held in a brutal embrace, was a long, curved shape. It was not wood.

It was bone.

A great, sweeping arc of ivory-grey, streaked with black anaerobic stains, thicker than my thigh and tapering to a point. It was caked in mud, but its essence was undeniable. It was a tusk. Or a fang. Or a horn. It was the physical manifestation of a myth, ripped from its bed of time.

The grab held it aloft over the water, a grotesque trophy. The rain fell on it, washing runnels in the grime.

The world shrank to that shape. The diesel roar faded. The hiss of the rain became the hiss of static, of a channel opening. I felt a pressure in my inner ear, a popping, as if I had descended too fast. The hollow ringing in my bones was gone, replaced by a new frequency—a deep, sub-auditory hum, a note of immense pain and immense age. It was not a song. It was a held chord of extinction, a vibration of loss so complete it had fossilised into sound.

*The naga itself. Not a myth. A corpse.*

This was it. The answer to the summons. I had been pulled here to witness this violation. This was the grafting. The new string was this monstrous, beautiful bone, and it was resonating with the old, broken pattern of the world, and the sound was unbearable.

I must have made a noise. Arjun grabbed my arm. “Eli?”

I couldn’t speak. I was listening. The hum was coalescing, forming something at the edge of meaning. Not words. A feeling. A vast, slow, curling sensation of *wrongness*. Of a sleep shattered. Of a body, dismembered and scattered, suddenly aware of its own separation.

Pak Hassan was shouting at the crane operator to lower it gently. But the grab was not designed for gentleness. As it began to swing towards us, one of the great steel teeth, slick with mud, slipped against the curve of the bone.

There was a sound.
A crack.

It was not loud. It was a dry, sickening snap, the sound of a dead branch giving way, amplified by the very resonance I felt in my teeth. The bone, twenty millennia old, survived by the perfect, silent chemistry of its preservation, fractured. A three-foot-long splinter sheared away from the main column. It twisted in the air, a pale dagger, and plunged point-down into the soft mud at the very edge of the dredge pit, a hand’s breadth from the dark water.

Time stopped.

The hum in my skull spiked into a silent scream. The pressure in my head was agony. I clapped my hands over my ears, but it was inside. Arjun was saying something, Pak Hassan was roaring, the crane engine whined. But it was all behind a thick pane of glass.

My eyes were locked on the splinter of bone in the mud. It stood upright, quivering. And as I watched, a thin, dark line of something began to weep from its fractured tip. Not mud. Something thicker, darker, with a rainbow sheen like rotting petrol. It oozed, slow and deliberate, down the ivory surface, and began to pool in the mud around its base.

The grab, now holding the main, broken body of the bone, settled onto the barge with a heavy thud. The damage was done. The surgery was botched.

The spiritual seeking had ended on the rooftop. The spiritual surgery had begun here, in the mud. And I had just felt the patient convulse.

The hum began to change. The note of loss was curdling, twisting into something else. Something active. Not pain, but purpose. A cold, ancient, and utterly alien purpose.

The pull was no longer just a hook in my soul. It was a command. It came from the oozing splinter in the mud. It was not a call to look. It was a call to *approach*.

I shook off Arjun’s hand. My movements felt slow, underwater. I stepped off the barge, back into the knee-deep mire. I didn’t look at the men calling after me. I walked towards the bone. The mud sucked at my shoes, trying to claim them. With each step, the hum clarified, organizing itself into a pattern, a rhythm. It was a pulse. A slow, deliberate, tidal pulse.

I stood before the splinter. The pool of black ichor was wider now, mirroring the grey sky. The bone itself seemed to throb with a faint, internal luminescence, a trick of the light and my straining senses. The fracture surface was a jagged mouth, weeping its ancient sap.

This was not an artifact. This was a wound.

And the city, this whole engineered island built on reclaimed sea and buried myth, was the body around it. I had asked for a connection. I had been granted one. It was not a melody to be sung. It was a hemorrhage to be stanched. Or a signal to be answered.

I knelt. The mud soaked through my jeans, cold and final. I reached out, my hand hovering over the weeping fracture. I did not need to touch it. The frequency was a physical wall here. It vibrated in the marrow of my own bones, a sympathetic resonance that was neither welcome nor safe.

The answer was a summons to the depths.

And the depths had answered back. Not with silence. With a slow, spreading stain, and a pulse that was now my pulse. The hook was set. The line was taut. And I was no longer holding the rod. I was the bait, and the catch, and the water into which the line descended, all at once.

I am home. And I am answered.

And the answer is bleeding in the mud before me, calling my name in a language older than tongues.

# Chapter 15

## **Chapter 15**

The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. It remembers. It falls now on the Kranji mudflats, a steady, grey hiss on the tidal slop, on the plastic flotsam, on the bowed backs of the men on the barge. It fell like this, perhaps, the day the thing in the mud was broken. It would have diluted the ichor then, too, spreading the stain into the groundwater, into the roots of the mangroves, into the slow, secret veins of the island.

I knelt in the centre of that memory. The cold of the mud was geological. It climbed my legs, a claiming chill. My hand did not tremble as it hovered over the fracture in the bone. It was held, suspended in the frequency that poured from the wound. The hum was inside my skull, a second, heavier heartbeat. It was not sound. It was pressure. The pressure of a deep place, a place without light, speaking upwards through a crack in the world.

Arjun’s voice came from far away, muffled by the drumming rain and the thicker wall of resonance. “Rafi! Get back!”

I did not look. Looking was for surfaces. The splinter was not a surface. It was an opening. The black sap welled, not with the randomness of seepage, but with a languid, purposeful rhythm. Each droplet formed, swelled, detached with the solemnity of a ritual gesture. This was not decay. This was utterance.

The purpose that had curdled in my chest was not my own. It was a borrowed will, an ancient imperative flowing into the hollow spaces the jet lag and the searching had carved out of me. I had come to Singapore a frayed thread, looking for an end to tie to. I had found the other end, but it was not loose. It was anchored in the abyss, and it was pulling.

I lowered my hand.

The moment before contact was a vacuum. The rain-noise vanished. The shouted warnings vanished. There was only the pulse, and the dark mirror of the ichor, and the bone that was not bone.

My fingertips touched the weeping fracture.

The world did not explode. It inverted.

***

The sensation was not of being pulled, but of being *unfolded*. A single, vertiginous lurch, as if the axis of my spine had been yanked sideways into a new geometry. The mud, the rain, the grey sky—they peeled away like a scrim. Not into darkness, but into a profound, textured absence. A negative space that was full of feeling.

I was in the mud. I could still feel its clammy grip on my knees, the rain spotting my neck. But I was also *elsewhere*. A elsewhere of pure resonance.

It was a cathedral of pressure. A landscape built not from stone and light, but from layers of silent sound, from the gravitational hum of immense weight, from the slow, crystalline grief of things forgotten. I had no eyes here, but I perceived. Above—a concept that had no meaning—was a crushing blanket of time, sediment compacted into eons. Below—another useless word—was a hot, mineral ache, the planet’s molten heart. And through it all, running like a fault line through the strata of silence, was the fracture.

It was a scar in the deep places. A ragged, singing tear. From it bled not ichor, but a profound and lonely *awareness*. It was the awareness of the buried thing. It knew its own brokenness. It knew its exile. It knew the miles of rock and water above it, the insignificant crust upon which a city of glass now danced. And it knew *me*.

My consciousness, a tiny, flickering candle in this vault of geologic self-regard, was seen. The attention that focused on me was vast and slow. It was the attention a mountain might give to a lichen speck on its flank. Curious. Oblivious. Potentially annihilating.

A concept formed, not in words, but in a shift of pressure, a new harmonic in the hum. It was a single, clear datum of communication, heavy with the patience of stone.

*You are of the surface.*

It was not a question. It was a categorization. I was a thing of the thin, noisy, ephemeral world. A mayfly.

Another pressure-shift. A different quality. This one carried a flavour of… recognition? Not of me, but of the quality of my seeking. The hollow ringing in my bones that I had mistaken for jet lag was a tuning fork, and it had been struck by a frequency from the deep.

*You called. You listened. You heard the break in the song.*

The song. The idea arrived with a cascade of associated sensations—a memory of a time when the pressure was melody, when the deep places sang to the surface and the surface sang back, a harmony of ley and flow, of root and rock and ritual. A time before the fracture.

Then, a new pressure. Sharp. Final. A verdict.

*You are the breach. You are the leak. You are the ear that hears the wound.*

Before I could form anything like a thought in response, the pressure shifted again, violently. The cathedral of resonance convulsed. The lonely awareness from the fracture was suddenly flooded with a new, alien signal—a skittering, chittering, metallic pulse. It was the sound of the city above, translated into the language of the deep. The MRT tunnelling through bedrock. The pile drivers hammering foundations into the ancient seabed. The ceaseless, draining suck of ten thousand air-conditioning units, pulling heat from the surface and vomiting it into the air. The digital chatter bleeding through the substrate.

It was noise. Profane, shrieking, structural noise. It clawed at the edges of the fracture. It was not part of the old song. It was its antithesis.

The awareness from the deep recoiled. The focus on me twisted into something else. Not curiosity, but utility. The pressure shaped a command, an imperative that was pressed into the very fabric of my being.

*Stanch the noise. Seal the breach. Mend the leak.*

*Or be unmade by it.*

The unfolded world snapped back.

***

I was on my hands and knees in the mud, vomiting salt water and bile. The rain was a physical assault. The world was appallingly loud—the shouts, the slop of waves, the diesel grumble of the barge engine. It was all that metallic, skittering noise, raw and undiluted. It felt like needles in my teeth.

Strong hands hooked under my arms. Arjun and one of the workers, their faces masks of mud and alarm, hauled me backwards. My legs were blocks of stone. They dragged me through the mire, back to the relative solidity of the barge deck. I collapsed against the gunwale, retching again, though nothing was left.

“What did you do?” Arjun’s voice was low, fierce. He crouched beside me, his hand on my shoulder. “Rafi. Look at me. What did you *do*?”

I tried to speak. My tongue was thick, foreign. I tasted mud and the ghost of that black ichor—a taste like old metal and stagnant lotus root. I looked at my hand. My fingertips were clean. There was no stain. But the vibration was still there, a sub-audible drone in the core of me. The command was there, etched into my nervous system.

*Stanch the noise. Seal the breach.*

I looked past him, towards the splinter of bone. The workers were gathered at the far end of the barge, speaking in rapid, hushed Hokkien. They were staring at the bone, but also at the water around it. I followed their gaze.

The pool of ichor was spreading. Not just a slick on the surface. The water itself, for a radius of several metres, was darkening, as if dyed from below. Tendrils of black were reaching out through the murky tide, delicate as ink in milk. And where the dark water met the wooden pilings of a nearby abandoned jetty, a faint, phosphorescent shimmer clung to the rotting wood, a sickly green-gold that pulsed in time with the hum in my bones.

“I listened,” I finally said, my voice a rasp. “And it answered.”

“What answered?” Arjun’s grip tightened.

“The thing that’s broken. The thing this city is built on top of.” I pushed myself up, my body protesting. The world tilted, then righted itself on its new, terrible axis. “It’s not a relic, Arjun. It’s a wound. And the city… the noise of the city is like grit in that wound. It’s an infection.”

He stared at me, his practical, engineering mind warring with what he had seen—the bone, the ichor, my reaction. “What are you talking about? Infection? This is mud. Old bone. Strange mud, okay, but…”

“You felt the hum,” I said, cutting him off. “You said it was in your fillings. That’s the breach. That’s the sound of it… leaking. Of the deep place bleeding into ours, and our noise bleeding back into it.” The concepts were forming into words now, clumsy and inadequate. “It’s a two-way rupture. And it’s getting wider.”

One of the workers, the foreman, approached cautiously. He ignored me, speaking directly to Arjun. “Cannot already, *boss*. This one is not our business.” He gestured sharply at the darkening water, the glowing pilings. “This is ** *pontianak* business. ** *Orang laut* ghost. We move the barge. Now.”

Arjun looked from the man’s frightened face to the spreading stain. He was a man of concrete and rebar, of permits and load-bearing calculations. But he was also a man who knew that Singapore was built on stories it had tried to bulldoze. The fear in his worker’s eyes was an older, more potent data set.

“Okay,” Arjun said, decisively. “We go.” He turned to me. “We’re leaving. Now.”

I didn’t argue. The imperative in me was not to stay. It was to act. But to act, I needed to understand. I needed to know what the “noise” was, specifically. And I needed to know how to “stanch” it. The answers were not in the mud. They were in the city that was causing the offence.

As the workers fired up the barge engine and we began to pull away from the site, I kept my eyes on the splinter. It receded, a pale thorn in a spreading blot of black. The hum receded with it, from a physical vibration to a persistent, internal tinnitus. But the command did not fade. It was a lodestone in my gut, pulling me towards the skyline now smudged by rain in the distance.

The city was the problem. The beautiful, brutal, engineered city. My home.

***

The journey back to the river mouth was silent. The workers avoided me. Arjun stood at the bow, his back tense, watching the water ahead as if it might suddenly congeal into something solid. I sat against the cabin, feeling the rain wash the mud from my jeans. It didn’t wash the cold away. That was internal.

By the time we docked at the makeshift jetty near Sungei Kadut, the rain had softened to a drizzle. The world had returned to its normal, garish colours—the green of rampant vegetation, the rust of corrugated roofs, the bright plastic of litter. It looked like a lie. A veneer over the true, resonant landscape I had glimpsed.

Arjun helped me off the barge. My legs held. “You’re going to Auntie Li’s?” he asked, his voice flat.

“Yes.”

“Good. Sleep. Shower. Forget today.”

“I can’t.”

He met my eyes then, and I saw the conflict there. The friend who was worried. The rational man who was terrified. “Rafi, listen to me. That thing out there… and what you did… I have worked on sites where old *keramat* shrines were disturbed. I have seen men get sick, machines break for no reason. There are rules. You don’t touch. You make an offering, you back away. You don’t *kneel* in it. You don’t put your hand in its mouth.”

“It wasn’t a *keramat*,” I said quietly. “It was older. It’s the reason the *keramat* were there in the first place.”

He shook his head, a gesture of surrender. “I don’t want to know. My job is to fill that lot with clean soil and foundation piles. That’s all. That’s my part of the song.” He used my word unconsciously, and flinched at it. “Go home, Rafi.”

He turned and walked back towards the barge, already barking orders to the workers to secure the vessel. The discussion was over. I was alone again, but the aloneness was different. I was not unmoored. I was tethered—to a wound in the mud, and to a purpose I had not chosen.

The walk to the main road, the wait for the bus, the ride back into the dense heart of the island—all of it was now filtered through the new lens. The bus’s engine was a grating snarl. The tinny music from a teenager’s headphones was a sonic barb. The shudder of the bus as it crossed an expansion joint on the bridge was a jolt to the fracture in my soul. This was the noise. This was the ceaseless, grating, mechanical dissonance that was pouring into the deep place. I felt it as an abrasion, a psychic pollution.

But how did one stanch it? You couldn’t silence a city of six million. You couldn’t un-invent the MRT, or switch off the air-conditioning.

*Auntie Li.* The thought surfaced, clear and cold. She was my tether to the surface world, to the human-scale history. She knew the stories. She knew the old maps, not of streets, but of flows and energies. If anyone understood the concept of a breach between worlds, it would be in the folklore she curated.

When I reached the shophouse on Spottiswoode Park Road, the sky was the colour of worn slate. The blue ceramic frog was in its place. I retrieved the key, my movements automatic. The shophouse was cool and dark, smelling of old wood and dried herbs. Silence.

It was a false silence. I could hear the hum of the refrigerator, the distant whine of a vacuum cleaner from next door, the subterranean rumble of a train passing somewhere deep below. All of it was the noise. I walked to the sink and turned on the tap. The gush of water was a roar. I flinched.

I needed to get out of my own skin. I shed my muddy clothes, left them in a heap on the bathroom floor, and stood under the shower. The water was a mercy, a neutral sound. But as I closed my eyes, I saw the ichor, the slow, purposeful droplets. I felt the pressure of the deep place. The command echoed.

*Stanch the noise.*

Dressed in clean, soft clothes, I felt marginally more human. The hollow ringing was gone, replaced by the permanent, low-grade hum. I was the ear that hears the wound. I would never know silence again.

I found Auntie Li in the back courtyard, carefully watering her collection of ferns and orchids with a small brass watering can. She didn’t turn as I approached.

“You have been to a wet place,” she said, her voice neutral. “A place of tides and forgetting.”

“How did you know?”

She finally looked at me, her eyes sharp behind her glasses. “You carry the smell. Not of mud. Of old water. Water that has lain under the ground for a long time. And something else. A… hollowness. Like a seashell.” She set the watering can down. “You found your connection.”

“I found a fracture,” I said, leaning against the doorframe. The words came out in a exhausted rush. “In the Kranji mudflats. A piece of something that shouldn’t be there. It’s bleeding, Auntie. And it’s aware. And it’s in pain. Because of us. Because of all of this.” I gestured vaguely upwards, at the city beyond the courtyard walls.

She was silent for a long moment, absorbing this. She did not look surprised. She looked resigned. “So. It is true. The old stories from the *orang laut*. The stories my grandmother whispered, about the Lion City’s shadow.”

“What shadow?”

“Not a shadow of buildings. A shadow in the water. A counterpart. A foundation.” She moved to a small wooden stool and sat, motioning for me to do the same. “You know Singapore is called the Lion City? A silly story, from a Sumatran prince who saw a beast and called it a lion. There are no lions here. But there are other guardians. Older ones.”

She folded her hands in her lap. “The story says this island is not just land. It is a capstone. A seal. Placed over a… a deep well. A place where the world is thin. The *orang laut*, the sea people, they were its keepers. Their songs, their rituals, their very movements on the water—it was a maintenance. A way of keeping the harmony between the world above and the world below. The ‘song’ you talked about.”

My blood went cold. “What was in the well?”

She shrugged, a very Singaporean gesture of pragmatic ignorance. “Who knows? A spirit? A dragon? A sleeping god? The source of all *semangat*? It does not matter what it is. It matters that it is *contained*. And that the seal requires harmony to hold.” Her eyes grew distant. “Then the British came. Then the dredgers. The land reclamation. The *orang laut* were moved ashore, their boats sold. Their songs forgotten. The harmony… stopped.”

“And the seal cracked,” I whispered, seeing the splinter in my mind.

“Perhaps. Or perhaps the noise from above—the digging, the pounding, the screaming metal—became too great. A constant shrieking against the capstone.” She looked at me, her gaze piercing. “You touched it.”

“It spoke to me. It gave me a command. To stanch the noise. To seal the breach.”

Auntie Li let out a long, slow breath. “Ah. So you are not just a listener now. You are an instrument.” She said it not with fear, but with a weary acceptance. “This is a heavy thing.”

“How do I do it?” The question was a plea. “I can’t quiet a city.”

“No,” she agreed. “But the noise is not uniform. The old maps—not the street maps, but the maps of *qi*, of spirit roads—they show places of confluence. Where the energy of the land gathers. Where the veil is thin. The old *keramat*, the shrines, they were often built on such spots. Not to worship, but to *manage*. To anchor the harmony.” She stood up, her movements suddenly brisk. “Come.”

I followed her back into the cool gloom of the shophouse. She went to a large, rosewood cabinet, unlocked it with a key from a chain around her neck, and pulled out a wide, flat drawer. Inside were not papers, but large, brittle sheets of *daluang* bark paper, covered in intricate, hand-drawn maps.

“These were copied from much older sources,” she said, carefully laying one out on the red marble table. “By a *bomoh* who worked for Raffles himself, they say. To know where not to build.”

The map was a rendering of the island, but utterly alien. Singapore’s familiar shape was there, but overlaid with a web of flowing lines, swirls, and nodes. It was less a geography and more a diagram of a circulatory system. There were notations in *Jawi* script. I recognized a few landmarks—Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill, now Fort Canning), the mouth of the Singapore River, the rocky outcrops at Tanjong Pagar.

“Here,” she said, her bony finger pointing to a node where several swirling lines converged, near the southern coast. It was marked with a symbol that looked like a weeping eye. “A place of powerful outflow. A place where the world below breathes into the world above.” Her finger traced a line inland, to a corresponding node on the map, this one marked with a symbol like a clenched fist. “And here. A place of intake. A listening ear.”

“Where are they?” I asked, my heart pounding.

She squinted at the tiny *Jawi* notations. “The outflow… is where the Marina Barrage is now. The intake…” Her finger tapped the fist symbol. “This is the site of the old National Theatre. The Van Kleef Aquarium. Places of gathering. Of sound.” She looked up. “Both are gone now. Rebuilt. Covered in concrete.”

Of course they were. The city had paved over its own pressure points.

“But the map shows the flows,” I insisted. “If the harmony was a circuit, and the circuit is broken… could the noise be concentrated at these points? If the deep place is ‘bleeding’ at the fracture in Kranji, maybe the ‘noise’ from the city is pouring in most strongly at these other weak spots. Amplifying the problem.”

Auntie Li considered this. “It is possible. If you want to stanch a wound, you do not just put a bandage on the cut. You must also clean the source of the infection.”

“So I need to go to these places. These nodes. I need to… I don’t know. Listen. Understand what the noise is there. See if it can be… corrected.”

“It is a theory,” she said, folding the map with great care. “A dangerous one. You are not a *bomoh*. You are a man with a hole in him, who has stuck his finger in a deeper hole. You may make things worse.”

“I have a command in my head, Auntie Li. I can feel it, like a compass needle. It’s pulling me. If I don’t follow it, I think it will unravel me. I am the breach, too.”

She studied my face for what felt like an eternity. Then she nodded, once. She handed me the folded map. “Take this. Be careful. The old places remember their purpose, even under the concrete. They may not welcome your interference. And the city… the city will not understand what you are doing.”

I took the brittle paper. It felt charged, like it held a static of its own. “Where should I start?”

“The intake,” she said. “The listening ear. The place where the city’s noise is sucked down. Find what it is hearing. Then you will know what you must silence.”

The old National Theatre. Van Kleef Aquarium. The site was now part of the sprawling Padang, near the new Esplanade complex. The very civic heart of modern Singapore.

I had my direction. The lodestone in my gut hummed in agreement.

As I turned to go to my room to study the map, Auntie Li spoke again, her voice soft. “Rafi.”

I looked back.

“You asked about your mother’s song. The one she hummed. The one you could never remember.”

I went still.

“I think you are hearing it now,” she said. “Not the melody. But the frequency. She was listening, too. She was just… closer to the source than was safe.”

She turned back to her cabinet, closing the drawer with a definitive click. The conversation was over.

I climbed the stairs to my room, the map crackling in my hand. The hum in my bones had found a focus. It was no longer a diffuse distress signal. It was a navigation tone, leading me to the city’s hidden ear.

I am home. And I am answered.

And the answer is a map to the places where the world is thin, and a command to make it thick again, starting with the deafening roar of the place where we gather to applaud.

# Chapter 16

## **Chapter 16**

The map was not a guide. It was a confession.

I spread it on the floor of my room, the paper sighing as it flattened, corners held down by a half-empty water glass, my phone, a book whose title I could no longer read. The overhead bulb, a single, unshaded eye, cast a stark, unforgiving light. The lines were not the crisp, confident strokes of a cartographer. They were spidery, hesitant, a topography of anxiety. Auntie Li had not drawn roads so much as she had traced scars.

And there, at the centre of the web, was the old National Theatre. She had not drawn the building itself. She had drawn a vortex, a series of concentric, wavering circles that bled into the Singapore River, lapped at the edges of the Padang, and sent faint, capillary lines out towards the vanished Van Kleef Aquarium and the skeletal outline of the old *Kallang Airport*. It was less a site and more a wound. A listening ear, she had called it. On the paper, it looked like a screaming mouth.

The lodestone in my gut, that constant hum I had carried since the void, pulsed in time with the drawn circles. It was not a pull anymore. It was a resonance. I was the tuning fork, and the city was the instrument. The realisation was cold, factual. My mother had been closer to the source. She had listened until the song was all she could hear. Until she was part of the frequency.

I had no tools for this. No holy water, no sacred chants, no blessed knives. I had a hole in my soul where a world should be, and a command etched into the static of that hollow space: *Mend the breach*. I was the breach, and I was the needle. The absurdity of it was a taste like tin foil on the tongue.

Sleep was impossible. The map crackled even when I wasn’t touching it, a low, papery static that frayed the edges of the quiet. The rain had returned, not the theatrical wall of my first night, but a persistent, whispering drizzle that made the night outside my window a smear of ochre streetlight and shifting shadow. I dressed in dark, practical clothes, clothes for moving unseen. I put the map in a plastic sleeve to protect it from the wet, though some part of me suspected the paper was less vulnerable than I was.

The shophouse was a vault of sleeping breath. Auntie Li’s presence below was a dense, watchful silence. I moved down the stairs like a ghost, each creak of the wood a thunderclap in the hush. The front door yielded with a click that sounded like a bone snapping. Then I was out in the five-foot way, the covered space that was neither street nor home, a space for waiting. Now it was a space for departure.

The city at three in the morning is a different incantation. The drumming rain had softened to a mist that hung in the air, a wet gauze that diffused the light and muffled sound. My footsteps on the pavement were the only clear note. I walked past shuttered noodle stalls, their metal grates down, past the 24-hour *kopi* shop where a lone man stared into the luminous green void of a gaming monitor, past the void-deck of an HDB block where a single fluorescent tube buzzed over empty chess tables. Singapore slept, or pretended to sleep. Its dreams were the silent glide of taxis, the hiss of street cleaners, the distant, sub-aural thrum of servers in climate-controlled towers.

I followed the river. The map’s capillary lines seemed to align with its flow. The Singapore River was a canal now, tamed, lit with tasteful LEDs, its banks lined with bars that were dark and chairs stacked like skeletal remains. But the water moved with a patient, muscular memory. It remembered when it was a vein of trade and sewage and life, when *tongkangs* jostled for space and the air was thick with the smell of spice and mud. It remembered the Theatre that had been built over its tributaries.

The Esplanade’s durian spines emerged from the gloom, their metallic skins beaded with moisture. The Padang, the great green field, was a black lake of shadow. And there, between them, was nothing. A vast, empty expanse of paved ground, slick with rain, reflecting the orange sodium lights of the civic district. The National Theatre was gone. Razed. Erased. Only the memory of its shape remained, implied by the space it did not fill.

But the map was right. The nothingness *hummed*.

I stepped off the proper path and onto the open plaza. The sound of my footsteps changed, became hollow, echoing as if I walked on a drumskin stretched over a cavern. The lodestone in my gut flared, a cold, magnetic ache. I stopped in what would have been the centre of the auditorium. The stage. The vortex on the paper.

I closed my eyes. Not to see, but to listen past the patter of drizzle, the distant traffic on Nicoll Highway.

At first, there was only the ringing in my own ears, the legacy of the void. Then, beneath it, a pressure. Not a sound, but the shape of a sound. The ghost of an echo. It was the roar of a crowd that was no longer there, the crash of a symphony that had long since ended, the forgotten lines of a thousand plays. It was civic noise, artistic noise, the collected human sound of a nation gathering to witness itself. But it was trapped. It had been poured into this concrete bowl and then the bowl was smashed, but the noise had nowhere to go. It pooled here, seeping into the land, a psychic runoff.

This was the intake. Not listening to the city. The city had been listening to *it*, drinking this stagnant, recycled sound. A feedback loop of forgotten applause.

I opened my eyes. The mist seemed thicker here, coiling at knee-level. The map in my hand grew warm through the plastic. The command in my head clarified, a single, clear imperative: *Silence the echo*.

But how does one silence a ghost?

I had no ritual. Only instinct. I knelt on the wet pavement, the cold seeping through the fabric of my trousers. I placed my palms flat on the ground. The concrete was vibrating, a faint, constant tremor. I thought of my mother, humming a tune she could not have heard with her ears. I thought of the hollow in myself. I was a vessel, empty. Perhaps that was the tool.

I did not try to push the sound down. I tried to open myself to it. To let the trapped roar flow into the hollow.

It hit like a tsunami.

A cacophony of decades flooded into me. The distinct, sharp laughter of a woman in 1978. The collective gasp of an audience at a tragic denouement. The thunderous ovation for a visiting dignitary. The tinny crackle of a forgotten microphone. The rustle of a thousand programmes. The coughs, the whispers, the shifting in seats. It was not a single sound but a layered, sedimentary deposit of human attention. It filled the void in me, not with substance, but with a screaming, spectral history. My bones became tuning forks, vibrating at a thousand different frequencies. My teeth ached. I could smell old perfume, mothballs from evening jackets, the ozone of stage lights.

I was not Rafi on a wet plaza. I was a node in a network of ghostly sensation. I saw flashes—the sweeping curves of the Theatre’s roof, the red seats, the glare of a spotlight. I felt the nervous excitement of a performer in the wings. I tasted the dry dust of a stage curtain.

And beneath it all, holding it all together like a fundamental bass note, was the command. The one that had been woven into the fabric of this place when it was built, the silent prayer of its architects: *Gather. Unite. Applaud.* A civic spell. It had worked too well. It had gathered the sound and given it nowhere to go.

I could not contain it. I was a small cup trying to hold an ocean. The pressure built in my skull, a white-hot needle behind my eyes. I was going to shatter. The noise would tear me apart and spill back out, worse, amplified by my broken vessel.

Then, a different note. A thin, clear filament of sound woven through the chaos. A hum. Not my mother’s song, but something adjacent. A frequency of stability, of *grounding*. It was coming from beside me.

With immense effort, I turned my head.

Auntie Li stood there. She was not in her nightclothes. She wore a simple, dark *samfu*, and her hair was neatly pinned. In her hands was a small, unglazed clay pot, the kind used for rooting cuttings. She held it lightly, but her posture was one of immense concentration. She was humming, a low, monotonous note that seemed to vibrate in the space between her lips and the pot.

She did not look at me. She looked at the ground where my hands were planted. She took a step closer, and her hum shifted pitch, just slightly. It became a counterpoint to the roar inside me. A drain.

She knelt, placing the clay pot carefully on the ground next to my knee. The pot was empty. It was a vessel, too. But it was a vessel made for this. An anchor.

“Let it go,” she said, her voice barely audible over the storm in my head. “Not into you. *Through* you. Into the earth. You are the conduit, not the reservoir. You are the needle. Sew it shut.”

I understood. I stopped trying to hold the sound. I focused on the lodestone in my gut, on the command to mend. I imagined myself not as a cup, but as a needle, a silver stitch. The roaring, ghostly noise was the torn thread. I let it flow into me, and with a wrenching effort of will, I pushed it *down*, through my bones, through my palms, into the wet concrete, into the soil and the forgotten waterways beneath.

The clay pot began to ring, a high, pure tone like a struck glass. The noise pouring out of me met Auntie Li’s grounding hum and was funneled, focused, into the earth. It was not erased. It was returned. The applause went back to the hands that had made it. The music dissolved into the molecules of the air that had carried it. The words evaporated into the night from which they’d come.

It took an age. The pressure slowly ebbed. The visions faded. The cold ache in my hands became just the cold of wet concrete. The ringing in the clay pot softened, then ceased.

Silence.

A real, profound silence. The mist on the Padang had cleared. The drizzle had stopped. The city sounds—a distant siren, the hum of the Esplanade’s machinery—returned, but they were ordinary now. They were not feeding into a hungry, silent mouth beneath the civic skin.

I slumped forward, catching myself on my hands. I was drenched in sweat and rain, trembling with exhaustion. My head felt scooped-out, clean.

Auntie Li picked up the clay pot. It was warm. A fine web of cracks now covered its surface. It had held, but just barely. She looked at me, her face etched with a deep weariness. “You see? It is not magic. It is acoustics. Spiritual acoustics. The city is full of poorly designed rooms. Rooms that trap sound. Rooms that amplify whispers into screams.” She helped me to my feet. My legs were water.

“You followed me,” I croaked.

“You are a lodestone,” she said simply. “You are easy to follow. And you are a fool. A brave fool. You tried to drink the sea.”

“It’s quieter now,” I said. The relief was a physical thing, a lightness in my chest.

“This ear is closed,” she agreed, looking around the empty plaza. “But the map has other marks. Other… poorly designed rooms. The aquarium. The airport. The cinema at Bras Basah. Each with its own trapped frequency. Each a leak in the dam.” She handed me the cracked clay pot. “Keep this. You will need to learn to make your own anchors. The next one may not have me to bring you a pot.”

I took it. It was still warm, a tiny hearth in my hands. “Why?” I asked. The question was vast. Why help me? Why this? Why her?

She began to walk, leading me off the plaza, back towards the living city. “Your mother was my friend. She heard the song, and it fascinated her. She went looking for the singer. I heard the song, and it frightened me. I learned how to mute it. We make our choices.” She glanced at me. “You did not choose the song. But you are choosing the needle. That is a different thing.”

We walked in silence for a block. The sky was beginning to pale at the edges, a thin, grey dilution of the night. “What was trapped at the aquarium?” I asked.

“Not sound,” she said. Her pace slowed. “Sight. The relentless, circular witness of thousands of captive eyes. A different kind of pressure. A visual echo.” She stopped, turning to face me. Her expression was grim. “That one… that one is more dangerous. Sound dissipates. Sight can be reflected. It can get inside you and show you things you cannot unsee. The command there is not *mend*. It is *forget*.”

The cracked pot in my hands felt suddenly heavier. The lodestone in my gut, quiet now, gave a faint, dull throb. Not a pull towards the next point, but a tremor of warning.

I had silenced an echo. The next task was to blind a memory.

Auntie Li touched my arm, a brief, dry contact. “Go home. Sleep. The map will wait. And you must learn to make a lid for the well before you look into it.”

She melted into the pre-dawn gloom, heading not towards Spottiswoode Park, but in another direction entirely. I was left alone on the empty street, holding a broken pot, the taste of old applause still like dust in my mouth.

The first breach was sealed. The hollow in me was no longer just an emptiness. It was a tool that had been used, a channel that had been scoured. It ached, but it ached with purpose.

I turned towards home, the first birds beginning their tentative calls in the trees along the river. The city was waking up, oblivious. It would never know that a piece of its ghostly, screaming infrastructure had been dismantled in the night. It would feel only, perhaps, a slight lessening of a tension it had never known it carried.

But I knew. And the map in my pocket, with its other vortexes, its other scars, was a ledger of work yet to do. The Van Kleef Aquarium awaited. A place of silent, swimming witnesses and a command not to mend, but to forget.

I am the needle. And the next stitch must be blind.

# Chapter 17

## **Chapter 17**

The Van Kleef Aquarium was a ghost long before it closed. It sat on the edge of the Singapore River, a low, brutalist block of stained concrete and glass that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. In the flat, hard glare of mid-morning, it looked like a bunker. A place built to withstand siege, not to display the delicate, darting lives of fish. The river water here moved with a thick, green languor, smelling of diesel and the deep, organic rot of forgotten things. The city had grown sleek towers around it, glass giants that turned their backs on the squat, ugly building, as if embarrassed by its persistent, crumbling memory.

I stood across the road, under the shade of a raintree. The pot from the theatre was back in my room, wrapped in a cloth, its silence now a familiar, quiet companion. The lodestone in my gut was not quiet. It was a slow, cold swirl, like oil on water. It did not pull. It watched.

Auntie Li’s words were a grit in my mind. *A visual echo. The relentless, circular witness of thousands of captive eyes.*

I had come to look, not to act. To learn the shape of the well before I tried to cap it. The command was *forget*. I did not know what that meant. Forgetting is not an action; it is an absence. You cannot *do* forgetting. You can only be emptied.

The main entrance was sealed with a rusted steel gate and a laminated notice from the Singapore Land Authority, the print faded to ghosts of words. But memory, I was learning, has more than one door. A service alley ran down the western side, choked with discarded PVC pipes and the skeletons of office chairs. Halfway down, a ground-level window was boarded not with plywood, but with a warped sheet of corrugated metal, one corner pried up and bent back with the patience of rust. A dark mouth exhaling air that was several degrees cooler, and carried the unmistakable, briny tang of stale saltwater.

The hollow in me flexed, a soft, acknowledging pulse.

I waited for a delivery van to rumble past, for the street to lapse back into its humid stupor. Then I crossed, slipped into the alley’s shadow, and knelt before the opening. The bent metal scraped against concrete with a sound like a dry cough. The space beneath was just large enough. I pushed my bag through first, then wriggled after it, the concrete catching at my shirt, the cool, damp air closing over my skin like a sheath.

Inside, the darkness was not complete. Fingers of daylight stabbed through cracks in other boarded windows, through broken panes high in the ceiling, illuminating swirling galaxies of dust. I was in a long, narrow service corridor. The walls were painted a dismal green to shoulder height, then a cream that had yellowed like old teeth. Pipes ran overhead, insulated with foam that hung in tattered, blackened strips. The floor was gritty with broken plaster and the crumbled remains of ceiling tiles.

And the silence. It was not the silence of the theatre, that tense, anticipatory hush. This was a thick, wet silence. A drowned silence. It pressed against my eardrums, a physical weight. The hollow in me stirred again, not in hunger, but in recognition. This place was full. Oppressively full. But what it was full of was not sound.

I followed the corridor, my footsteps the only breach in the quiet, absurdly loud. It opened into the main concourse.

The vast space stopped me. A cathedral of decay. The ceiling was a vault of exposed concrete ribs and rusted metal trusses. The far wall was one great, curving window, twenty feet high, looking into the principal tank. The glass was a cataract, clouded with algae and mineral deposits, a greasy, greenish film that blurred the world beyond it into a murky dream. Faint, shifting light penetrated from the river side, painting the interior of the hall in aqueous, wavering patterns. It felt less like a room and more like the belly of a ship that had sunk into very deep, very still water.

Smaller display tanks lined the walls to my left and right, their glass smashed or so thickly coated with grime they were opaque. Their frames were rusted scabs. Here and there, a pale, plastic castle or a synthetic frond of seaweed lay amidst the debris on the floor, toys in a forgotten nursery.

But it was the big tank that commanded the space. That demanded witness.

I walked towards it, my neck craning back. The clouded glass gave nothing away. It was a wall of secret, stagnant green. I pressed my palm against it. It was shockingly cold, and damp condensed instantly around my skin. I leaned in, peering, trying to see past the veil of algae.

A shape moved.

Vast, grey, and slow. It drifted parallel to the glass, a spectral leviathan in the gloom. My breath hitched. It was a concrete replica of a whale shark, suspended on thick, corroded cables from the ceiling of the tank. Its paint was peeling, its blank eye a dark socket. It hung there, a monument to a failure of imagination, turning in some infinitesimal current of air.

The lodestone went still. Then it turned over, a slow, sickening roll.

I understood. The echo here was not in the water. It was in the glass. The glass was the membrane. For decades, living eyes had pressed against this side, wide with wonder or boredom or a child’s fleeting curiosity. And on the other side, thousands upon thousands of captive eyes had looked back. Fish eyes, round and unblinking. The stare of groupers, passive and ancient. The frantic, skittering gaze of sardines in a shimmering school. The cold, assessing regard of a shark. An unbroken circuit of seeing and being seen. A perpetual, silent exchange of witness.

When the living left and the fish died or were taken away, the circuit did not break. It shorted. The glass remembered. It held the imprint of all that looking. A visual resonance trapped in a transparent medium, replaying forever. Not an image, but the *act* of sight itself. The pressure of being watched. The weight of being a spectacle.

*A visual echo.*

I took a step back from the glass. The hollow in me was no longer a channel; it felt like a lens. I could feel the pressure of the accumulated gaze beginning to focus. It was not directed at me yet. It was simply *on*, a beam searching for a retina to land upon.

A soft click echoed through the hall.

I froze. The sound had not come from the tank. It had come from the shadows near a broken turnstile, leading to what might have been a gift shop.

“You feel it, don’t you?”

The voice was male, calm, and educated. It came from the darkness, and a moment later, a man stepped into a shard of light. He was in his late fifties, perhaps, dressed in neat khaki trousers and a faded polo shirt. His hair was thin, grey, swept back. He held a large, professional-looking torch, but it was switched off. In his other hand, he held a small, leather-bound notebook.

“Most people just get a headache,” he said, moving closer. His eyes were pale, sharp behind wire-framed glasses. “A sense of being crowded. They leave quickly. But you… you walked right to the epicentre. You put your hand on the glass.” He stopped a polite distance away. “You’re not here for urban exploration.”

The lodestone was a hard, cold knot. This was not part of the map. “Who are you?”

“Dr. Aris Thorne.” He said it not with pride, but with a weary precision. “I was the senior marine biologist here. For the last eight years of its operation.” He looked past me at the clouded tank, his expression one of profound, intimate sadness. “I tried to save them, you know. The specimens. When they decided to close, the proposal was to… euthanise most of the larger animals. Ship a few to other facilities. I fought it. I lost.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Are you?” He looked at me directly, and his gaze had the same quality as the echo in the glass: assessing, patient, trapped. “You’re here for the resonance. The *nodus*.”

The word hung in the damp air. A clinical term. A pin to stick in a butterfly.

“What do you call it?” I asked.

“A psychic scar. A cognitive feedback loop.” He tapped his temple. “I’ve been studying it since I realised what was happening. The last year we were open, the staff attrition rate was ninety percent. Unexplained migraines. Aphasia. Nightmares featuring… overwhelming perspectives. Visitors reported sudden, intense claustrophobia. Paranoia. The feeling of being stared at from inside their own heads.”

He walked past me, right up to the tank, and placed his own palm on the glass, mirroring my earlier gesture. “It’s the eyes. The optic nerve is a biological cable. It transmits electrical impulses. But on a fundamental level, it transmits *attention*. And attention leaves a mark. This place…” He leaned his forehead against the cold glass. “This place is a flytrap for attention. It soaked it up for decades. Now it broadcasts it back, on a loop. A silent, screaming stare.”

I thought of the theatre, the screaming trapped in the mortar. “You know about these things. These… echoes.”

“I know this one.” He pushed off from the glass and turned to face me. “I’ve mapped its boundaries. Its intensity peaks at the central tank, but it permeates the entire structure. It is, in my hypothesis, strengthening. As the physical structure decays, the non-physical imprint becomes more… assertive.” He opened his notebook, showed me a page of neat, precise diagrams—energy fields, wave patterns. “I have developed a damping theory. A counter-resonance. But it requires a catalyst. A focus.”

He looked at me, and his pale eyes were no longer just sad. They were hungry. “You are a focus. I felt the disturbance last night. Over at the old theatre. A sharp, concussive quieting. And then you appear here, the next day, drawn to the next major locus. You are not a researcher. You are a practitioner.”

The word was a key turning in a lock. Practitioner. It sounded so sterile. So safe.

“Auntie Li sent you,” I said. It wasn’t a question.

He smiled, a thin, humourless stretching of lips. “Madam Li and I have an understanding. I provide the science. She provides the… metaphysics. And the access to individuals with the requisite empathic hollow.” He took a step closer. “You have the hollow. I have the method. Together, we can cap this well. Not with superstition. With applied parapsychology.”

The lodestone throbbed, a warning beat. This was wrong. Auntie Li had spoken of a command: *forget*. This man spoke of damping, of counter-waves. He spoke of the echo as a problem to be solved, not a memory to be released.

“What is your method?” My voice was quieter than the silence.

He gestured with his torch towards a door marked ‘Filtration & Pump Control’. “The resonance is anchored in the glass, but it is amplified by the architecture. The circular sightlines. The reflective surfaces. My calculations indicate that by introducing a specific, discordant frequency at the three main structural nodes, we can collapse the feedback loop. Shatter the echo.”

“Shatter it,” I repeated. “And what happens to the sight that’s trapped? The witness?”

“Dissipated. Neutralised.” He said it like he was discussing a chemical reaction.

But Auntie Li had said *forget*. Not destroy. To forget is an act of mercy. To shatter is an act of violence. The hollow in me knew the difference. It had been used to mend a scream, to give it an end. It recoiled at the idea of shattering a memory.

“I need to see it,” I heard myself say. “The echo. Properly. Before anything is done.”

Dr. Thorne’s eyebrows rose. “That is exceptionally unwise. To look directly at the compiled gaze is to risk a profound psychic retrojection. You could lose your sense of self in a million borrowed perspectives. You could go blind.”

“I still need to see.”

He studied me for a long moment, then sighed, a sound of academic disappointment. “Very well. The catalyst must be willing. Come. The best vantage is from the old viewing gallery. Above the tank.”

He led me through the control room door, into a labyrinth of dripping pipes and dead control panels with buttons like blind eyes. A metal staircase, slick with condensation, spiralled upwards. We emerged onto a narrow gantry that ran in a U-shape around the top of the big tank, looking down into it. The fake whale shark hung below us, a grey tombstone. From up here, the greenish light from the river window was stronger, illuminating the water that still filled the tank—a deep, stagnant broth of neglect.

“Stand there,” Thorne said, pointing to the centre of the gantry. “Look down. Do not try to look *away*. Let the gaze find you. I will observe from here.” He switched on his torch, not to illuminate, but I saw he had a small digital recorder clipped to his notebook. He was going to document this.

I moved to the spot. The railing was cold and wet under my hands. I looked down into the murky water, at the suspended concrete shark, at the filth-streaked walls of the tank.

I opened the hollow.

It was not like opening a valve. It was like removing a lens cap. The internal emptiness ceased to be a receptor and became a conduit.

The pressure in the room changed. The thick, wet silence congealed. Then, the glass of the tank below me seemed to *shimmer*. Not with light, but with a sudden, terrifying depth. It was no longer a barrier. It was a window into a vast, collective eye.

And it looked up.

It was not a single stare. It was a kaleidoscope, a torrent. The placid, round eye of a giant grouper, seeing nothing but the endless, blue-walled world. The frantic, black pinpricks of a school of anchovies, seeing motion and shadow and the flash of silver sides. The flat, ancient eye of a ray, seeing the sandy floor drift past. The cold, conical eye of a barracuda, seeing prey, always prey. And human eyes, wide and small, pressed against the other side: a child’s wonder, a tourist’s bored glance, a lover’s distracted gaze.

Thousands of moments of seeing, layered, compressed, and played at once. A deafening visual shout.

It poured into the hollow. It was not images, but the raw *experience* of sight—perspective, focus, attention, fear, boredom, hunger. I was a grouper in a blue prison. I was a child pointing a sticky finger. I was a sardine turning as one with the school. I was a biologist, noting faded colours with a clinical despair. The perspectives crashed over me, through me, each fighting for dominance. My own vision blurred, doubled, fractured into a hundred sightlines. I saw the gantry from below. I saw the river from inside the tank. I saw my own face, pale and stricken, from a dozen different angles and through a dozen different kinds of eyes.

The command rose from the chaos, not in words, but as a desperate, silent need: *FORGET*.

Forget the prison. Forget the staring faces. Forget the slow passage of identical days. Forget the feel of artificial current. Forget the shadow of the concrete shark. Let it all be a dream, unremembered, dissolving into the dark.

But Thorne’s theory was wrong. The echo didn’t want to be shattered. It wanted to be *released*. It wanted the mercy of oblivion.

A hand gripped my arm. Thorne’s voice, sharp and close. “Fascinating! Your biofield is spiking. You’re drawing the resonance into a coherent stream! Hold it. *Hold it*! This is the catalyst state!”

He was pulling me back, away from the railing. My own sight snapped back into place, a painful, singular focus. The torrent of borrowed vision receded to a screaming background hum. I was panting, my nails digging into the rusted metal.

“Now,” he said, his eyes alight with a fervent, clinical joy. “While you are acting as a focal point, I can apply the damping frequency at the nodes. The feedback loop will overload. It will be magnificent.”

He let go of me and hurried along the gantry to a small metal box he had evidently pre-installed. He flipped a switch. A low, electronic hum joined the wet silence, a teeth-vibrating thrum that felt utterly alien in this place of organic memory.

The lodestone in my gut went cold. Then it *pulled*.

It was not a pull towards a place. It was a pull against an action. A deep, instinctual *no*.

The hum from Thorne’s device intensified. The shimmer in the glass below grew jagged, frantic. The collective gaze I’d channelled wasn’t dissipating. It was being *torn*. The command of *forget* was being twisted into a scream of rupture.

I saw it then. Thorne didn’t want to heal the scar. He wanted to study the explosion. I was not a partner. I was a probe.

“Stop,” I said, but my voice was a rasp, lost in the electronic drone.

He didn’t hear me. He was adjusting a dial, reading a meter on his device.

The hollow in me, still wide open, reacted. It had been made to mend. To give silence to sound. It recognised this electronic thrum as a new kind of violence. And it did not channel the echo away from me. It did something else.

It reflected.

The torrent of trapped sight, the desperate need to *forget*, hit the invasive, shattering frequency of Thorne’s device—and the hollow bounced it back. Not at the tank. At the source.

Thorne gasped. His glasses fell from his face, clattering on the gantry. He staggered back, his hands flying to his eyes.

“What are you…? The patterns… they’re inside…” His voice was a whisper of utter terror.

He was seeing it. Not studying it. *Living* it. The entire, compressed, decades-long loop of captive witness was flooding into him, unfiltered, unmediated by the hollow’s mercy. He was the grouper, the child, the sardine, the biologist, all at once, with no centre to hold onto. His own scientific gaze was being swallowed by the million-eyed stare.

He screamed. A short, sharp sound that was cut off as his knees hit the metal walkway. He curled into a fetal position, his hands clamped over his eyes, moaning.

I slammed the hollow shut. The connection severed. The electronic hum from his device sputtered and died. The shimmer in the glass faded back to a mere, greasy film.

The silence returned, heavier than before.

I walked over to him. He was shaking, his breaths coming in ragged hitches. “Too many,” he whimpered. “Too many eyes. Can’t… can’t find mine.”

Auntie Li’s warning. *It can get inside you and show you things you cannot unsee.*

I had not looked away. I had let it in, and the hollow had processed it, translated its agony. Thorne had tried to force it, and it had broken him. He had been blinded, not by darkness, but by a surplus of sight.

I left him there, moaning on the gantry. There was nothing in my practice for this. No command to mend a shattered observer.

Down in the main hall, the tank loomed, silent once more. But the command within it was clearer now. It was not for me. The *forget* was not a spell I could cast. It was the echo’s own deepest wish. My role was not to act upon it, but to *listen* to that wish. To acknowledge it. Perhaps that was the lid for the well: not a cap of stone, but an act of profound, final witness that allowed the thing witnessed to finally close its own eyes.

The map in my pocket was a ledger. The aquarium was a scar that wanted to fade. Thorne’ science was a scalpel where a whisper was needed.

I exited through the broken window, back into the alley’s heat and the river’s rotten smell. The world was glaringly bright, painfully singular. My own eyes felt raw, newly grateful for their simple, solitary point of view.

But as I walked, a new sensation began. A faint, familiar pull. Not from the lodestone. From my hands. A faint, tingling warmth where they had gripped the gantry railing.

I looked down at my palms. There was no mark. But the feeling was there. A gentle, insistent tugging, like a string tied to a finger, leading away from the river, back towards the heart of the city.

The hollow was quiet. The work at the aquarium was unfinished, but its nature had changed. Thorne was a complication I had not foreseen.

And now, something else was calling. Not a scream. Not a stare. A pull on the hands. A tactile echo.

The needle felt the next thread. It was not sound. It was not sight. It was touch. And it was waiting, somewhere in the heat, to be felt.

# Chapter 18

## **Chapter 18**

The pull in my hands was a new grammar. The hollow had always translated sound into pressure, a resonance in the bone. This was different. It was a direct, physical tether, a line of silent tension running from the centre of my palms into the city’s grid. It did not throb. It did not ache. It was a constant, gentle insistence, like the tug of a child who has taken your hand and will not be ignored.

I walked. The afternoon was a steam bath, the air thick with the memory of the morning’s rain and the promise of more. The river’s stink faded, replaced by the layered stenches of a thousand lunches being fried, of diesel, of the sweet, cloying decay of flowers in the *pak khaw* market. My hands led. They turned me left at the mouth of Amoy Street, right onto Telok Ayer. The city was a riot of colour and noise, but I moved through it like a needle through felt, following a thread only I could feel.

It was not a seeking. It was a being-led.

I thought of Thorne, broken on the gantry. His science had been a form of deafness. He had tried to shout down a well, to command an echo. The echo had shouted back, with light. A surplus of sight. My own method—the hollow, the listening—had spared me that. But it had changed me. The aquarium’s silent scream had been processed, metabolised, and this new sensitivity in my hands was the residue. The hollow had learned a new sense. It had tasted the texture of a place’s pain, and now my skin remembered the flavour.

The pull led me away from the shophouses, into the canyon of Tanjong Pagar. Glass and steel towers rose, their surfaces mirroring the bruised sky. The thread ran straight through them. I passed the mouths of MRT stations, streams of people pouring out, their faces slick with the humidity, eyes fixed on phones. I was a ghost moving against the current, my attention turned inward to a map of tension in my tendons.

It ended at a building. Not a heritage shophouse, not a cursed aquarium. A modern condominium, twenty storeys of blue-green glass and pale concrete. *The Clift*. It stood at the edge of the district, aloof. The thread did not point to the main doors. It angled sharply, leading down the service lane beside it, to a discreet, recessed entrance marked *Delivery & Utilities*.

The door was propped open with a brick. Inside, a loading bay, empty but for a pallet of water bottles. The air was cool, humming with the bass note of central air-conditioning. The pull in my hands intensified, becoming a distinct downward pressure. *Below*.

I found the service stairs. My footsteps echoed on bare concrete. One flight down. Then another. The light grew dimmer, the hum of the building’s machinery louder—the groan of pumps, the whir of fans. The stairwell opened onto a basement level. A corridor lit by flickering fluorescents, lined with doors: *Electrical*, *HVAC*, *Storage B*.

The pull was a fist now, clenching around my own. It led to the last door, unmarked. The handle was cold. It turned. The door opened onto darkness and a smell that stopped my breath.

Not rot. Not decay. Something cleaner, sharper. The mineral tang of ozone, like after a lightning strike, undercut with the dry, papery scent of static. And beneath that, the faintest whisper of sandalwood incense.

I stepped inside. My eyes adjusted. It was a small, square room, a forgotten utility space. The floor was concrete, the walls bare. But in the centre of the room, someone had drawn a circle. Not with chalk or paint. It was inscribed into the concrete itself, a groove perhaps an inch deep, perfect in its geometry. Within the circle, the floor was scuffed, worn smooth in patches, as if from pacing.

And in the circle, sitting cross-legged, was a man.

He was perhaps sixty, thin, wearing simple cotton trousers and a white singlet. His eyes were closed. His hands rested on his knees, palms up. He was utterly still. But the air around him was not. It shimmered, a heat-haze distortion that had nothing to do with temperature. The ozone smell was strongest here, emanating from him, from the circle.

The pull in my hands released. The tension snapped, leaving a phantom ache. This was the source. This silent man in a basement, sitting in a ring of carved stone.

I did not speak. I leaned against the doorframe, waiting. The hollow was quiet, but my skin prickled with the charged air. This was not a place of echo. This was a place of containment. The circle was not a summoning. It was a prison.

After a long minute, his eyes opened. They were a pale, watery brown. They focused on me without surprise, as if he had been expecting me, as if my arrival was a scheduled event.

“You feel it,” he said. His voice was raspy, unused. “The leakage.”

I looked at my palms, then back at him. “What is it?”

“A side effect.” He unfolded his legs, stood with a stiffness that spoke of hours, days, in that position. He was shorter than I’d thought. “Of trying not to feel anything else. You are the listener. The one from the aquarium.”

It wasn’t a question. I said nothing.

“He tried to make it a tool,” the man said, nodding slightly, as if I had confirmed everything. “Thorne. The scientist. He thought the resonance could be harnessed. Measured. He was a fool. But a useful fool. He led me to the site. And now, he has led you to me.” He took a step forward, but stopped at the very edge of the inscribed circle. He did not cross it. “My name is Arif.”

“What are you containing?” I asked. The spiritual seeking was not mine, here. It was his. I was just the witness his practice had inadvertently called.

“Myself.” He said it simply. He held up his hands. They were ordinary, lined. “I was a *bomoh*. Not the theatrical kind you see in Geylang for love spells. A real one. My family line… we dealt with attachments. Spirits that cling. Places that remember too much. We would listen. We would negotiate. We would… release.”

He looked at the circle around his feet. “The method is absorption. You take the clinging thing into your own vessel. You hold it within you, where it is safe, where it can be calmed. Then, slowly, you let it dissipate. Like breath on a mirror.” He looked at me, his gaze sharp. “You understand. Your hollow. It is a similar principle. But you are a translator. I was a prison.”

“Was?”

“The aquarium,” he said, and the ozone smell spiked, sharp and electric. “Thorne had stirred it up. Made it frantic. It was a big thing. An old, collective pain. I went to help. To absorb the… the screaming stare, as you call it.” He smiled, a thin, bitter stretch of lips. “I was arrogant. I thought my vessel was strong enough. I took it in. All of it.”

He closed his eyes, remembering. “It was too much. Too sharp. Too many points of view. It was not a single ghost. It was the ghost of a place where too many things had ended in terror. I could not hold it. I could not begin to let it go. It would have unspooled through me, into the world. A psychic shockwave.”

He opened his eyes and gestured to the circle. “So I made this. A feedback loop. I sat in the centre. I drew the pain into me, and the circle pushed it back into me. A closed system. A perfect containment. I am the well. And I am the lid.”

The spiritual seeking had turned into a self-immolation. He had sought to heal a scar by becoming the scar tissue.

“The pull I felt,” I said. “The leakage.”

“A crack,” he nodded. “The system is not perfect. Energy escapes. Not the memory itself—not the images, the sounds. The *effort* of holding it. The static. The ozone. It leaks out as a… a call for grounding. For a conductor.” He looked at my hands. “You felt it as touch. Your method is attuned to pressure. You felt the pressure of my holding.”

“Thorne is blind,” I said.

Arif’s face showed a flicker of something—regret, or grim satisfaction. “He looked directly into the sun. The release, when I first contained it, was… bright. He was in the wrong place. A casualty.”

“And the echo? The thing in the tank?”

“It is quiet now,” Arif said. “It is here. With me. It is no longer a scream. It is a weight. I have given it a single point to focus on. Me. It is simpler for it now. And for the world.” He took a deep, shuddering breath. “This is my service now. To sit. To hold. Until I die. Then… the circle will break. And it will flood out. But that is a problem for another day.”

I understood then the false victory. At the aquarium, I had believed I’d found the answer: witness, not command. I had seen Thorne’s hubris shattered. I had felt I’d grasped a deeper truth. But I had only seen the first act. The true resolution had already happened, here in this basement. Arif had performed the ultimate act of witness—he had *become* the memory. He had not solved the problem. He had taken it upon himself, permanently.

My revelation was a child’s understanding. His was a life sentence.

“Why did you call me here?” I asked. The pull had been intentional. A leak is still a signal.

“To see,” he said. “To know the cost. And because the leakage… it is getting worse. The crack is widening. I cannot repair it from inside. The circle is both my prison and my sustainer. To break it is to release everything, prematurely.”

He took a step closer to the edge. The shimmering air around him intensified. “You are a different kind of vessel. You do not hold. You channel. You translate. You could… siphon the leakage. Not the core weight—that would destroy you as it would have destroyed me. But the static. The excess pressure. You could ground it. Dissipate it into the world quietly, through your hollow, where it would be harmless. It would give me more time. It would keep the system stable.”

The proposal hung in the ozone-tinged air. He was not asking for rescue. He was asking for maintenance. For a caretaker for his eternal vigil.

“What would it do to me?” My voice was flat.

“I do not know,” he admitted. “It is not memory. It is the friction of memory. It might… attune you further. It might wear grooves in your spirit. It is a burden of a different kind.”

The spiritual seeking had led here, to a choice between two types of sacrifice: his absolute, or my incremental. There was no victory. Only different shapes of bearing.

I looked at the circle, at the man inside it. He had sought the deepest possible union with a wound. He had found it. And now he was drowning in it, asking for a rope that was also an anchor.

“How?” I asked.

He pointed to a spot on the floor, just outside the circle. “Sit there. Put your hands on the line. The inscription. Let the hollow open. Not to listen. To… receive. To earth.”

I moved slowly. The concrete was cool through my trousers. I sat facing him, the carved groove between us. I placed my palms flat on the floor, my fingertips just touching the outer edge of the circle.

I closed my eyes. I did not need to drop a stone. The well was already here. I simply removed the lid from my own hollow.

It was not a sound that rushed in.

It was a vibration. A pure, searing frequency of effort. The strain of a mind holding a continent of grief. It was the scream of a muscle that cannot relax. It had no images, no words. It was the essence of *holding*. It flooded up through my hands, into my arms, a current of sheer, taut will.

My teeth clenched. My bones hummed. It was not painful in the usual sense. It was *loud* in a way that had nothing to do with ears. The hollow, accustomed to processing specific echoes, scrambled. It was not translating. It was being used as a drain.

I felt Arif’s relief. A slight softening of the terrible tension. The ozone smell lessened, just a fraction. The shimmer in the air subsided.

And into me flowed the static.

It did not stay. The hollow, true to its nature, could not hold it. It passed through me, this neutralised energy of containment, and bled out. I felt it dissipate into the floor, into the air of the basement, becoming nothing. A sigh into a sigh.

But the passage left a mark. A resonance. A new sensitivity. When I finally pulled my hands back, breaking the contact, the world felt different. The hum of the building’s HVAC was not just a sound; I felt its vibration in my molars. The flicker of the fluorescent light was a physical pulse against my skin. My sense of touch had been amplified, made porous. I could feel the texture of the air, the pressure of the basement around me.

I was not a prison. I had become a tuning fork.

Arif was watching me, his expression one of profound, weary gratitude. “Thank you,” he whispered. The word seemed to cost him.

“How often?” My voice sounded strange to me, layered with the ghost of that vibrational hum.

“When the pull finds you,” he said. “It will. Now that you have connected, the leak will find its path. It will guide you back.” He settled back into his cross-legged position. “You have not finished the aquarium’s business. You have simply taken over its… upkeep.”

The false victory was complete. I had not resolved the haunting. I had enrolled in its eternal maintenance. Thorne’s science had broken. My spiritual insight had revealed not a solution, but a chain of custody. And I had just added my name to the list.

I stood up. My legs were unsteady. The amplified world was overwhelming. The coarse texture of my own shirt against my neck was a roar.

“What happens if I don’t come back?” I asked.

He closed his eyes, returning to his vigil. “The crack widens. The static becomes a shriek. Someone else will feel it. Someone like Thorne. Or worse. And one day, the circle will fail before I die. And the old scream will return to the aquarium, fresh and hungry, looking for new eyes to blind.”

He said no more. The conversation was over. I was dismissed.

I left him there, in his silent, shimmering cell. The service stairs felt like a climb out of a tomb. When I pushed open the door to the service lane, the humid assault of the late afternoon was a physical blow. The noise of the city was a wall of textured sound I could feel on my face.

I walked, aimless at first. The pull was gone. In its place was a new, pervasive awareness. I could feel the subway running deep below the street, a distant thunder in my soles. I could feel the press of the towering buildings, not as sight, but as a subtle pressure on my eardrums. The hollow was quiet, but my whole body was now an echo chamber for the world’s vibrations.

I had sought a deeper truth. I had found a deeper service. A life sentence of silent, tactile stewardship over another man’s sacrifice. The map in my pocket was no longer just a ledger of wounds. It was a maintenance schedule. And I had just accepted my first assignment.

The needle had felt the next thread. It was not sound. It was not sight. It was the constant, whispering vibration of strain. And it was not waiting. It had woven itself into me. I was no longer just following the map.

I was becoming part of the territory.

# Chapter 19

## **Chapter 19**

The awareness was a new kind of gravity. It did not pull from a single point, but from everywhere at once. The city was no longer a collection of objects, but a lattice of tensions. I felt the hum of high-tension wires strung between HDB blocks as a taut, metallic song along my jaw. The deep, grumbling complaint of a piledriver in the new Downtown Line extension was a fist slowly clenching in my gut. My walk was no longer aimless. It was a navigation through a field of invisible pressures, a man wading through a sea of silent vibrations.

I found myself on the pedestrian bridge over the Singapore River, the water a slick, black muscle in the evening light. The tourist bars along Boat Quay were beginning to thrum with a different frequency, a shallow, rhythmic pulse of bass and forced laughter. I leaned on the railing, the cool metal a sharp, clarifying line against my palms. Below, a tourist barge puttered past, its electric motor a dentist’s-drill whine that set my teeth on edge. I closed my eyes. Beneath the tourist veneer, I could feel the old river’s memory—the groan of wooden *tongkangs*, the slosh of night soil, the deeper, older silence of the mangroves that had been paved into financial districts. The past was not a story. It was a resonance trapped in strata, and I was developing a sensitivity to its specific pitch.

The map in my pocket was a cold, flat square against my thigh. I did not need to take it out. The location it implied was not a point on a street grid, but a knot in the vibrational field. The old aquarium. The hollow. The monk in his shimmering prison. That was a locus of profound, artificial silence, a vacuum that pulled at the edges of my new perception. But the needle in my mind—the one that had once twitched toward sound—was now tracing a different thread. It quivered, not toward silence, but toward a specific, escalating strain. A place where the lattice was bending, close to snapping.

It led me east, away from the river’s curated history, into the labyrinth of Geylang.

The rain had returned, not as a solid wall, but as a persistent, warm mist that haloed the streetlights and turned the air into a broth of exhaust and *teh tarik* and the damp, vegetal smell of produce boxes stacked outside the late-night markets. The five-foot ways here were cluttered with plastic stools, bicycles, the spill of light from open-fronted eateries. The noise was a cacophony—the sizzle of woks, the rapid-fire dialect of uncles playing chess, the tinny prayer song from a Hindu shrine wedged between a motorcycle repair shop and a money changer. It was a texture so thick I could almost chew it.

But underneath, the thread pulled. A dissonance. A vibration that was not in harmony with the chaotic, living hum of the place. It was a dry, splintering sound felt rather than heard, like the slow tear of cheap canvas.

I turned into a side lane, narrower, darker. The colourful signage faded. Here were the back ends of warehouses, the blank faces of storage facilities, a few darkened, two-storey shophouses with ornate, grimy façades hinting at a grander, forgotten past. The strain was centred on one of these. Number 37. The windows were boarded with new, untreated plywood, a raw yellow against the soot-stained plaster. A padlock, thick and shockingly bright, hung on a rusted gate that barred the entrance to the five-foot way.

I stood before it. The sensation was unmistakable. It was a psychic tinnitus, a high, tight frequency that made the bones of my inner ears ache. This was not a hollow. This was a splinter. A place where something had happened—violently, abruptly—and the shock had never been absorbed. It had been left to vibrate, to fray the edges of reality around it. Thorne’s science would have called it a traumatic resonance. The monk might have called it an un-whispered scream. I had no name for it. I only knew it was a tear in the fabric, and the map—and whatever had rewired my senses—had brought me here to witness it.

This was the maintenance. Not the silent vigil over a contained wound, but the assessment of a new one.

A voice, dry as dust, came from the shadows to my left. “Looking for someone?”

An old woman sat on a low stool in the recessed doorway of the neighbouring shophouse. She was barely a silhouette, wrapped in a dark *sarong kebaya*, a tiny red ember from a cigarette the only point of life in her face.

“No,” I said. “Just… looking.”

The ember bobbed. “Nothing to see. Empty for years.”

“It doesn’t feel empty.”

The words were out before I could stop them. They hung in the damp air. The ember glowed brighter as she took a long drag.

“Feel,” she repeated, the word devoid of curiosity. A statement. “You one of those. From the temple? The government?”

“No.”

“Good. They come. They take pictures. They write. They go.” She exhaled a stream of smoke that was instantly absorbed by the mist. “It doesn’t go.”

I took a step closer, out of the drizzle. The strain from Number 37 was a physical pressure against my right side. “What happened?”

“Fire,” she said, simple and final. “Long time. Not a big fire. A small, hungry fire. Upstairs.” She gestured with her chin. “A family. The man worked at the port. The woman sewed. Two children. A girl, a boy.” She listed them like items on a manifest. “The fire ate the oxygen. They slept. They did not wake up.”

A tragedy. A private, terrible grief. But Singapore was paved over private grief. This was different.

“And then?” I prompted, my voice low.

The red ember traced a slow circle in the dark. “Then the noise. After they cleared, after the boards went up. Not from inside. From… the space. A sound like… bending bamboo. Like a ship’s rope pulled too tight. Every night. For months.” She tapped her temple. “Drove the *ang moh* accountant next door away. Gave the Indian tailor migraines. Then, one day, it stopped. Just like that. But the quiet it left… it is not a good quiet. It is a listening quiet.” She finally turned her head, and I caught the faint gleam of a watchful eye. “You feel the listening?”

I did. The splintering sensation was the sound of that silence under immense tension. It was listening for an echo that never came.

“Why do you stay?” I asked.

The shrug was almost imperceptible. “I am old. My quiet is inside me. Their quiet is outside. We have an understanding.” She flicked the cigarette stub into a puddle where it died with a hiss. “You should go. Understanding takes time. You don’t have time.”

“How do you know?”

“You are standing like the building is shouting at you.” She shifted, the rustle of her clothing like dry leaves. “It is not shouting. It is holding its breath. When it decides to exhale, you do not want to be here.”

A cold clarity washed over me. The monk’s hollow was a contained, managed wound. This was an open, festering one. The map wasn’t just a record; it was a triage system. And this site was critical. The monk’s sacrifice held a crack closed. No one was sacrificing anything here. The crack was widening on its own.

I reached out, not with my hand, but with that new, awful attention. I pushed it toward the boarded-up doorway of Number 37. I felt the dry, splintering vibration, the held breath. And then, beneath it, I felt the four points of absence. Not hollows, but negative spaces, shaped like people. A deeper cold, a vacuum that the tension wrapped around. They were still there. Not ghosts. Echoes of a terminal silence, trapped in the moment of its creation.

My stomach turned. This was not a haunting to be resolved. It was a wound that had cauterised itself incorrectly. The tissue had grown back twisted, binding the memory into the very bricks and mortar.

The old woman was right. I had to go. But not to leave. To understand what was required. The monk had become a living damper, a human silencer. What did this splinter need? A release valve? A burial?

As I turned, the old woman spoke once more, her voice now barely a whisper. “The boy’s toy. A metal car. Red. It fell through the floorboards, into the shop below. They never got it back.”

A detail. A tiny, anchoring fact in the metaphysical catastrophe. I nodded, a gesture she probably couldn’t see, and walked back into the mist-shrouded lane. The vibrational thread from Number 37 remained attached to me, a taut line of discomfort anchored between my shoulder blades. I was no longer just sensing the territory. I was collecting its burdens.

I walked for hours, a sleepwalker through a city of invisible strains. I felt the low-grade psychic scar of an old traffic accident near a busy intersection, a persistent ripple of shock in the asphalt. I felt the gentle, sorrowful resonance of a demolished kampung, now a car park, its memory a faint, humid sigh under the concrete. The map was alive in my mind, each of Thorne’s marks now glowing with a specific qualitative signature. Some were dormant, quiet scars. Some, like Number 37, were active, weeping lesions.

The spiritual seeking was over. I had not found enlightenment, or peace, or even answers. I had been conscripted as a sensory organ for the city’s pain. I was a living tuning fork, struck once by the hollow’s silence and now forever vibrating to the hidden frequencies of Singapore’s unresolved past.

Dawn was a grey smear in the sky when I finally stumbled back toward Spottiswoode Park. The world was softening into monochrome, the night’s textures blurring. My body was a shipwreck of exhaustion, but my mind was horribly clear. I needed a plan. I needed to understand the rules of this stewardship. The monk was one model. There had to be others.

As I approached the shophouse, I saw a figure sitting on the front steps, under the ixora. Not Auntie Li. A man. He was hunched, elbows on knees, staring at the wet ground. He felt my approach and looked up.

It was Ben, the historian from the archives. His face was pale, his eyes wide with a fear that had eroded his usual academic composure. He looked like a man who had seen a ghost, or finally understood a terrible truth in a dusty document.

“You,” he breathed, standing up. He was clutching a manila folder to his chest like a shield. “I’ve been waiting for hours. I didn’t know where else to go.”

His normal frequency was gone. In its place was a jagged, erratic pulse of panic. It clashed against my own overloaded senses.

“Ben. What is it?”

“You asked me about the aquarium. About the silence.” He swallowed, his throat clicking. “I kept looking. Not at the aquarium. Around it. The context.” He thrust the folder toward me. His hands were trembling. “I found the architect. And then I found the project before the aquarium. And the one before that.”

I took the folder. The paper inside felt charged, dangerous.

“He had a specialty,” Ben said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, though the street was empty. “Thorne. His firm. They weren’t just building public works. They were being hired, quietly, by the government, by private entities… for remediation.”

“Remediation of what?”

Ben’s eyes locked onto mine. “Of places. Places where things happened that couldn’t be explained. That caused… disturbances. A factory in Jurong where machinery would fail for no reason. A stretch of road in Mandai with an impossible number of accidents. A school corridor where children kept hearing whispers.” He pointed a shaking finger at the folder. “It’s all in there. Proposals, invoices, vague descriptions. He didn’t fix them. Not like an engineer. He… contained them. He designed structures to dampen, to isolate, to *hold*.”

The monk’s words echoed in my skull. *My prison is also a filter. A baffle box.* Thorne wasn’t just a scientist of acoustics. He was an architect of silence. A builder of metaphysical containment units.

“The aquarium was his masterpiece,” I said, the pieces slotting into place with a cold, logical finality. “A perfect, resonant chamber. Not to hold fish. To hold a scream.”

Ben nodded, a frantic, jerky motion. “But I followed the money. The trail. The aquarium project was funded by a shell company. Untraceable, almost. But I am a very good historian.” A strange, grim pride flickered in his terror. “It led back. To a holding company. And that company… it was a subsidiary. Of a family office.”

The mist around us seemed to grow colder. “Whose family?”

Ben’s mouth worked for a moment before the name came out. “The name on the deed for the land the aquarium was built on. Before it was a failed seafood restaurant. Before it was anything.” He took a step closer, the smell of his sweat and fear sharp in the damp air. “It was owned by a *baba* family. Very wealthy. Very private. They sold it for a pittance in the late 80s. The family name was… Li.”

The world did not tilt. It simply focused, with a razor’s-edge precision, on the single, obvious point I had been too blind to see. Auntie Li. Her convenient shophouse. Her vague stories. Her absence when things became… metaphysical. Her knowing exactly where to send me.

She wasn’t just a kindly landlady with a spare room. She was a stakeholder. A custodian. Perhaps the latest in a line of them.

Ben saw the understanding dawn on my face. “You know something,” he accused, his fear curdling into something like anger. “You’re involved. I brought you the archive box, and then you vanished, and now… now I’m seeing things. Hearing things in my flat. A sound like… like static in the walls. It followed me home from the records hall.”

Of course it had. He had touched the thread. He had pulled on the history, and the history had felt his attention. He was not like me. He had no rewired senses, no monastic training. He was just a man who had looked into the abyss of Singapore’s suppressed resonance, and the abyss had glanced back.

“You need to leave Singapore, Ben,” I said, my voice flat, final.

“What? I can’t just—”

“You can. You must. Go on holiday. Visit family. Now. Today.” I gripped his shoulder. The vibrational panic radiating from him was nauseating. “Forget the folder. Forget Thorne. Forget the aquarium. It is not a historical curiosity. It is a live mine. And you are standing on it.”

He stared at me, his academic’s mind fighting against the visceral, animal truth he now felt. The static in his walls was winning the argument.

“What are you going to do?” he whispered.

I looked past him, at the door to my shophouse. At the blue ceramic frog, the stubborn ixora. The door behind which a seemingly benign old woman held the keys to more than just a rental property.

“I,” I said, “am going to have a conversation with my landlady.”

I left him on the steps, a scared man clutching his dangerous knowledge. I entered the shophouse. The familiar smells of lemon polish and old wood greeted me. The space felt different now. Not a refuge, but an outpost. The sitting room was empty. I walked through to the back, to the small, shaded courtyard where Auntie Li tended her orchids.

She was there, not gardening. She was sitting perfectly still on a stone bench, her hands folded in her lap. She was dressed not in her usual housedress, but in a simple, elegant *cheongsam* of dark blue silk. She looked like she was waiting for an important guest. Or a reckoning.

She looked up as I entered. Her face was serene, but her eyes held no surprise. Only a deep, weary acceptance.

“You have been to the quiet place,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“I have met its keeper,” I replied.

She nodded slowly. “And now you have seen another kind of wound. The kind that is not kept.”

“Number thirty-seven, Geylang.”

A flicker of something—respect, perhaps—crossed her features. “You are a fast study. That is good. And not good.” She patted the space on the bench beside her. “Sit. You are vibrating like a plucked string. You will make the orchids nervous.”

I sat. The stone was cool through my trousers. The gentle hum of the refrigerator from inside the house was a distant, mundane comfort.

“The Li family,” I said. “You.”

“My husband’s family,” she corrected softly. “I married into the duty. He has been gone ten years. So it passes.” She looked at her hands, at the simple gold wedding band she always wore. “The scream in the aquarium… it belonged to my husband’s great-uncle. A sensitive man. A poet. He heard something he should not have heard, in a place that no longer exists. It unravelled him. It lived in him, and when he died, it did not die. It… spilled. Thorne was hired to bottle the spill.”

The matter-of-fact way she said it was more chilling than any dramatic telling.

“And you? What is your role?”

“The family oversees the covenant. We ensure the keeper is… kept. Provisions. Security. Discretion.” She met my gaze. “And we watch for new threads. For people like you. The sensitive. The drawn. The ones who feel the map before they see it.”

My rental. Her kindness. It was not chance. It was recruitment.

“You brought me here.”

“I provided the address,” she said. “You found the door. You turned the key. You followed the thread. That is not on me. That is in you.” She leaned forward, her voice dropping. “The monk’s way is one way. A noble one. A life of pure containment. But it is not the only way. The map Thorne left… it is not just a maintenance guide. It is a… a curriculum. For a different kind of steward.”

“A fixer,” I said, the word bitter on my tongue.

“A resolver,” she countered. “The monk contains a single, massive wound. The map points to a hundred smaller ones. Festering splinters, like the one you felt in Geylang. They weaken the whole. His silence is the dam. Your work would be to shore up the riverbanks, to prevent new cracks from reaching it.”

The scale of it was staggering. A secret, silent maintenance crew for the soul of a city that pretended to have no past, only future.

“And the boy’s red car?” I asked, testing her.

She did not blink. “An anchor. A focal object. To resolve a splinter, you must often find the physical anchor of the trauma and… reposition it. Lay it to rest with the proper rites. It gives the silent echo a point of release. The car is still in the building. In the rubble. It holds a piece of the boy’s silence.”

She knew. She knew about every mark on the map. She was the silent dispatcher.

“Why me?” The question was a plea.

“Because you are unmoored,” she said, not unkindly. “You have no life here to disrupt. No family to endanger. You have the sensitivity. And you have the choice that the monk did not have. You can say no. You can leave. You can get on a plane and the hum in your bones will fade, in time, to a bad memory.” She paused, letting the offer hang in the humid air. “Or you can stay. You can learn. You can use this curse of perception to mend, instead of just to suffer.”

The hook was not in the mystery anymore. It was in the terrible, practical offer of purpose. A use for the hollow ringing. A meaning for the map.

“What would be my first task?” I heard myself ask.

Auntie Li’s lips curved into a smile that held no joy, only solemn resolve. She reached into a fold of her *cheongsam* and produced a small, old key, tarnished with age.

“The red car,” she said. “You located the splinter. You identified the anchor. The next step is retrieval. Before the silence there decides to exhale.”

She placed the cold, heavy key in my palm. It was for the padlock on the gate at Number 37.

The maintenance schedule was no longer theoretical. My first assignment was not observation. It was excavation. I was to go into that listening quiet, find a dead boy’s toy, and somehow, through an act I did not yet understand, use it to suture a tear in the world.

I closed my fingers around the key. It felt less like a tool and more like the first link in a new chain.

The needle had felt the thread. It had pulled me across the world, through silence and into sound, and now into the vibrating space between. I had thought I was becoming part of the territory.

I was wrong.

I was being given my first parcel of land to tend.

# Chapter 20

## **Chapter 20**

The key to the padlock at Number 37 was a weight in my pocket. It was not the key’s own mass, which was slight, but the density of the silence it was meant to unlock. I carried it from Auntie Li’s shophouse back to my own, the afternoon sun a hammer on the pavement, turning yesterday’s rain into a thick, visible steam that rose from the concrete. The city was breathing out. The hollow ringing in my bones had changed its tune. It was no longer a question. It was a low, preparatory hum, the sound a plucked string makes just before it is tuned to its proper note.

I climbed the stairs to my room. The map was on the desk, a sprawl of suffering I had only begun to catalogue. The red pin at the construction site was a wound. My task was to clean it. The monk, Tharman, had located the splinter—the boy’s toy car, a nexus of unfinished love and sudden terror. My sensitivity had confirmed it, had felt the silent, screaming shape of it. Now I was to retrieve it. Not for evidence. Not for closure. For an act of spiritual hygiene.

Auntie Li’s instructions had been precise, and spare. “Go at the lull. Three PM. The site is quiet then. The machines are sleeping. The men are at tea. You will have an hour of the day’s deepest breath. Find the car. Do not touch it with your bare skin. Use the cloth.” She had given me a square of undyed linen, coarse and plain. “Place it in the box.” The box was a simple thing of *meranti* wood, unvarnished, with a clasp but no lock. “Then you bring it here. We will prepare it for the rite.”

“And the rite?” I had asked.

“One thing at a time,” she had said. “First, you must meet the silence on its own ground. You must take something from it. That is a different kind of listening.”

Back in my room, I laid out the tools. The cloth. The box. A small torch. My own fear, a cold, slick stone in my gut. This was not passive perception anymore. This was intervention. I was a needle being asked not just to feel the tear in the fabric, but to begin the stitch. The responsibility was a physical pressure, a band tightening around my temples.

At half-past two, the heat was a solid presence. I walked. The city’s sound was a blanket—the distant growl of traffic, the arrhythmic percussion of construction from other sites, the murmur of a thousand air-conditioning units exhaling damp heat. I was a moving part through a still life. The map in my mind was no longer abstract. The red pin was a destination. I was walking toward a specific grief.

The fence at Number 37 appeared, a corrugated tin barrier stained with rust and street dust. The padlock hung from the chain-link gate, a dull black slug. The site beyond was a crater of arrested ambition. The excavation pit was a deep, rectangular wound, shored up with metal braces. At its bottom, a pool of rainwater reflected the hard blue sky, a misplaced piece of heaven in the mud. The silent crane stood sentinel, its hook a frozen question mark.

This was the lull. No generator hum. No shouted Hokkien or Bengali. Just the liquid coo of a spotted dove from a nearby *angsana* tree, and the buzz of flies over a discarded lunch packet.

The key turned in the padlock with a gritty, metallic shriek that seemed to tear the quiet. I winced at the volume of it. I slipped through the gate, closed it behind me, and the world shrank to the dimensions of the pit.

The air in the site was different. Thicker. It held the smells of damp clay, rust, and diesel, but beneath that was the sterile, metallic scent of concentrated quiet. The hum in my bones sharpened, resolving into a single, thin note, high and steady, like the sound a wineglass makes when a finger traces its rim. It was coming from the north-east corner of the pit, where the rubble of the demolished annexe had been piled before work stopped.

Auntie Li’s directions had been clear. *Third level of the terrace, western retaining wall, behind the fallen lintel*. I picked my way down the temporary wooden stairs fixed to the pit’s side. The wood groaned under my weight. Each step was a concession to gravity, a descent into the bowl of silence.

The mud at the bottom was treacherous, sucking at my shoes. I moved toward the rubble pile. The fallen lintel was a long, grey finger of reinforced concrete, half-buried in broken brick and tile. The boy’s silence was here. It was not a memory. It was a climate. The air was colder. The flies avoided this spot.

I switched on the torch. The beam cut through the shadow under the lintel, revealing a cavity. There, nestled in a cradle of dust and crumbled mortar, was the car.

It was a toy sedan, once bright red, now faded to a rusty pink. One of its plastic wheels was missing. The windshield was a web of cracks. It was not buried, not hidden. It was placed, with a terrible, deliberate care, in a small, clean space of its own. A shrine of one.

The high note in my bones became a vibration in my teeth. This was the anchor. This was the object that held the boy’s final, uncomprehending moment, the love for his father that had nowhere to go, the terror that had been swallowed by concrete. It was a seed of pure, unresolved emotion. A splinter in the skin of the world.

I did not want to touch it. My every instinct screamed to leave it, to back away, to let the earth take it when the bulldozers finally returned. But the hum was a command. The key in my pocket was a promise.

I unfolded the square of linen. The coarse fabric felt correct, impersonal. I knelt in the mud, the damp immediately soaking through the knees of my trousers. The cold was intense. My breath fogged in the beam of the torch.

I reached out, the cloth draped over my hand like a shroud. My fingers closed around the car.

The silence exploded.

It was not a sound. It was the vacuum left when all sound is ripped away. It was a roar of absence. The world did not go dark—it went *flat*, stripped of dimension, like a photograph. The grey of the concrete, the brown of the mud, the pink of the toy, all bled into a single, muted tone.

And then the feeling came. It was not a memory played in my head. It was a direct transfusion.

A child’s fierce, hot love, a sun burning in the chest. The smell of his father’s shirt—starch and cigarettes and safety. The thrilling, secret joy of being somewhere forbidden, of being a co-conspirator in a game of hide-and-seek from the foreman. The rough texture of the unfinished concrete under small knees.

Then, the shift. A deep, groaning shiver through the floor. Not a sound, but a vibration in the marrow. The sun of love snuffed out by a flood of animal fear, so acute it was a taste of copper in the mouth. The sight of the ceiling cracking, a black spiderweb against the grey. A desperate, wordless scramble. The toy car, clutched too tight, falling from a hand that was suddenly empty. The world tilting, dissolving into a storm of grey dust and crushing noise.

And then… the quiet. A quiet so vast, so complete, it had a texture like wool packed in the ears. A quiet that lasted for hours that felt like forever. A quiet where the only thing left was the fading imprint of a red car against the mind’s eye, and a question that had no words: *Abah?*

It was not a ghost. It was an echo trapped in a jar. And I had just lifted the lid.

I gasped, wrenching my perception back into my own skull. I was on my knees in the mud, trembling violently. The linen-wrapped car was in my hand. It felt inert now, just old plastic and metal. But I had felt its contents. I had drunk the dregs of that silent, final hour.

With fumbling hands, I placed the car in the wooden box. The moment the lid closed, the high note in my bones ceased. The ordinary sounds of the city filtered back in—the dove, a distant siren, the sigh of the wind in the crane’s cables. The silence of the pit remained, but it was no longer charged. It was just quiet.

I stood up, my legs weak. The box under my arm was light, but I carried the weight of the boy’s last afternoon. It was inside me now. I had not just retrieved an object. I had taken custody of a story.

The climb out of the pit was harder. The box required one hand. The wooden stairs seemed steeper. When I reached the top and turned to look back, the cavity under the lintel was just a shadow. The anchor was gone. The silence was already different—lighter, emptier, waiting to be filled with something else.

I locked the padlock behind me. The metallic clank was final. I walked back through the steaming streets, the box held close. People passed me, talking on phones, carrying shopping, living lives that were not interrupted by echoes. I felt like a courier for an invisible world, carrying a secret so small and so devastating it could fit in a wooden box.

Auntie Li was waiting in the back room of the shophouse. The air was cool, scented with sandalwood and the faint, dry smell of herbs. She had cleared the low table. On it was a shallow brass bowl, a small vial of clear oil, a bundle of dried sage, and a new, blank sheet of rice paper.

She saw the box in my hands and her eyes, old and dark as tea, read everything in my posture, in the set of my mouth.

“You met it,” she said. It was not a question.

“I felt it,” I replied, my voice rough. “His… ending.”

She nodded, gesturing for me to place the box on the table. “To retrieve an anchor is to share its burden for a little while. It is the cost. Now, we transform the burden. We change its address.”

She opened the box. With a reverence that had nothing to do with affection and everything to do with precision, she lifted the linen-wrapped car and placed it in the brass bowl. She did not unwrap it. She took the vial of oil and let three drops fall onto the linen. The scent of camphor and something else, sharp and clean like crushed pine needles, filled the space.

“The car is the anchor,” she said, her voice low and rhythmic. “It holds the shape of the silence. The boy’s *shen*—his spirit, his consciousness—is long gone. What remains is the *po*, the earthly soul, the echo of bodily feeling and unresolved emotion. Stuck. Like a fingerprint on glass.”

She lit the bundle of sage with a wooden match. The smoke rose, not in a plume, but in a slow, coiling ribbon. She passed the bowl through the smoke, once, twice, three times.

“We are not erasing the fingerprint,” she continued. “We are transferring it. From a object of trauma, to a vessel of release.” She placed the smoking sage in a ceramic holder and took up the blank rice paper. “You located it. You retrieved it. Now, you will map it.”

She handed me a fine-tipped ink brush and a small stone inkwell. “Close your eyes. Hold the shape of the silence you felt. Then, let your hand draw the shape of it on the paper. Not a picture of the car. Not a word. The shape of the echo itself.”

It was an impossible instruction. Yet, after what I had just experienced, it felt like the only logical next step. I closed my eyes. The memory of the silence was there, immediate and visceral. It was not a image. It was a form—a sharp, jagged compression followed by a long, hollow, cold stretch. A spike, then a flat line.

I opened my eyes, dipped the brush, and let my hand move. I drew a single, violent, downward stroke, dark and thick. Then, from its tip, I drew a long, thin, horizontal line that trailed off the edge of the paper. It was stark. It was ugly. It was exactly what I had felt.

Auntie Li studied it. “Yes,” she whispered. “The fracture and the silence.” She took the paper, held it over the brass bowl, and touched the corner to the still-smoldering sage. It caught fire.

She did not drop it. She held it as it burned, her fingers steady, letting the ash fall directly onto the linen-wrapped car in the bowl. The black flakes settled like a second shroud.

“The map is not always a place,” she said, watching the last corner of paper curl and blacken. “Sometimes it is a state. You have mapped the state. Now the anchor is no longer bound to the object. It is bound to the map. And the map,” she said, blowing gently on the ashes, “can be moved.”

She carefully folded the linen over the ashes and the car, making a neat package, and placed it back in the wooden box. “Tomorrow, before dawn, we will take this to the sea at East Coast. We will give the silence back to the water, to be dissolved and carried away. The rite of release.”

She closed the box. The room felt different. The air was clearer. The oppressive weight I had carried from the construction site was still present, but it was no longer a chaos inside me. It was contained, in the box, mapped and ready for disposal. The process was practical, almost clinical. It was spiritual seeking rendered as a craft.

“You have done the first full cycle,” Auntie Li said, looking at me. “Location. Retrieval. Mapping. Soon, release. This is the work. This is how you tend the land.”

I thought of the other pins on my map. The sobbing in the lift shaft. The cold spot in the hospital corridor. The weight on the bed in the old hotel. Each one was a splinter. Each one required this same meticulous, painful extraction. The scale of it was daunting. I was one person with a box of linen and a brush.

“It will take lifetimes,” I said, the fatigue hitting me all at once.

“It does,” she agreed. “But you are not doing it for all the silences everywhere. You are doing it for the one in front of you. You are a needle, mending one stitch at a time. The territory is vast. Your parcel is small. That is the only way it can be borne.”

She handed me the box. “Keep it with you tonight. Let it settle. The echo is now between addresses. It is safest with the one who mapped it.”

I took the box. It felt different. Not lighter, but integrated. It was a task in progress, not a raw wound.

I walked back to my room in the violet dusk. The city’s lights were coming on, turning the glass towers into grids of gold. The ordinary world was asserting itself with its noise and its light. But I carried a small, quiet darkness under my arm, a contained silence that was now my responsibility to see through to its end.

That night, I placed the wooden box on my desk beside the larger map. I slept, but my dreams were not my own. I dreamed of slow, dark water, and of something small and heavy sinking down through the greenish light, trailing a cloud of black ash like ink.

I woke just before dawn to the sound of my phone vibrating on the wooden floor. A message, from an unknown number. No text. Just a single image file.

I opened it.

It was a photograph, taken in low light. It showed a section of a concrete drainage culvert, a *longkang*, choked with muddy water and litter. And there, half-submerged in the muck, was a child’s sandal. Pink, with a faded plastic flower on the strap.

Beneath the image, a location was tagged. A street name in Toa Payoh. A place not yet marked on my map.

The humming in my bones, which had quieted to a bare murmur after the mapping, returned. A new frequency. A higher, more frantic pitch. It was not an echo from the past.

The timestamp on the image was from three hours ago.

This was not a parcel of land to tend.

This was a dispatch.

The needle had not finished its first stitch before it was being pulled toward a new tear. The territory was not static. It was alive, and it was calling. Not with the slow, cold silence of decades, but with the fresh, wet silence of a single, recent night.

# Chapter 21

## **Chapter 21**

The rain in Toa Payoh was a different animal. It was not the silver wall of Spottiswoode Park. It was a greasy drizzle that clung to the sodium-orange streetlights and made the asphalt shine like the skin of a wet fish. The air here smelled of damp concrete, of *bak kut teh* from a late-night stall, and underneath it all, the faint, metallic tang of water that has run through too many pipes, over too much stone. I stood at the mouth of the tagged street, the image on my phone a cold square of light in my hand. The pink sandal, the plastic flower. The timestamp, ticking forward in my head. Three hours was nothing. Three hours was a lifetime.

The humming was a live wire under my skin. It was not the deep, resonant frequency of the old, mapped silence. This was a sharp, insistent buzz, a Morse code of dread. It did not pull from the soles of my feet. It pulled from behind my sternum, a hook set deep in the bone. This was not an echo. It was a signal. And it was active.

I had left the shophouse with the wooden box in my backpack, the map folded carefully inside my jacket. The ordinary world of the violet dusk was gone, peeled back to reveal this other layer, this wet, urgent membrane. The city at this hour was a creature of shifts and shadows. Taxis hissed past, their tyres whispering on the wet road. A lone man pushed a cart of cardboard, the wheels squeaking a protest with every revolution. I was a stitch pulled loose, moving against the grain of the night.

The tagged location led me not to a house or a shop, but to a service road behind a row of HDB blocks. The blocks loomed in the darkness, a chessboard of lit and unlit windows. Below them, at ground level, was the drainage network. The *longkang*. A concrete channel, perhaps four feet wide, cutting a straight, grim line between the towering residences and a darkened playground. The channel was full. The rain had seen to that. The water moved with a slow, brown purpose, carrying with it the detritus of the day: a plastic bottle, a sodden newspaper, a single flip-flop. It moved towards a larger culvert, a dark mouth half-submerged beneath the road.

I knelt on the wet grass verge, the damp immediately soaking through the knee of my trousers. I took out my phone, compared the image to the reality. The angle was right. The photograph had been taken from here, looking down into the channel where it curved. The sandal was gone. Washed away, or removed. But the place held the signal. The air was thick with it. It was the silence after a scream has been cut short. A positive, aggressive silence.

I closed my eyes, not to listen, but to feel. The mapping had taught me that. The land did not speak in words. It spoke in pressure, in temperature, in the subtle directional tug of a memory that had weight. This memory had no age. It was fresh. It was bleeding.

The pull came from downstream. Towards the culvert.

I stood, my joints stiff. The backpack with its box of contained silence felt alien on my shoulders, a relic from a different kind of war. This was not a war of attrition. This was a search party. I followed the channel’s edge, my shoes slipping on the wet grass. The hum in my chest tightened, a string tuned to a breaking point.

The mouth of the culvert was a circle of pure blackness, a pupil in the eye of the city. Water poured into it with a low, gulping sound. A rusted iron grate, meant to catch larger debris, was partially torn away, bent backwards like a ripped fingernail. The signal pulsed from that darkness. It was a beacon in reverse, drawing the cold towards it.

I could not go in there. Not physically. The water was deep, the current stronger than it looked. And the darkness was a solid thing. But the signal did not originate from within the pipe. It pooled there, collected by the flow, but it was spilling from somewhere else. Somewhere upstream. Somewhere dry.

I tracked backwards, my senses straining against the mundane noise of the night—a distant siren, the thump of bass from a passing car. The humming began to differentiate. It was not a single note. Underneath the sharp panic was a thread of something else. A warmer frequency. Confusion. A disorientation that was not born of fear, but of simple, profound loss.

It led me away from the main channel, up a shallow, weed-choked embankment, to a narrow footpath that ran behind a row of locked storage units. The path was lit by a single, flickering lamp. And there, tucked against the corrugated metal door of a unit, was a small, forlorn shape.

It was a school bag. A child’s backpack, bright purple with a cartoon character I didn’t recognise. It was unzipped, gaping open. A few textbooks and a pencil case had spilled out onto the wet ground, the pages already bloated and ruined. Next to it, lying separate, was the other pink sandal.

I did not touch them. I stood over them, and the two frequencies of the hum resolved into a terrible chord. The sharp panic—that was the place, the *longkang*, the conduit. The warmer confusion—that was here. This was the point of severance. The bag had been dropped. The sandals had come off. The signal was not of a thing that had been placed, but of a connection that had been broken. Violently, and recently.

This was not a parcel of land. This was a thread. A thread that had been snapped, and the two raw ends were vibrating, sending out a distress call across a frequency only the lost, and the foolish, could hear.

I heard a scuffling sound from the deeper shadows between two storage units. A low, ragged breath.

I went still. The ordinary fear, the animal fear of a dark alley, was a cold wash over my scalp. But underneath it, the hum did not change. It recognised the sound.

“Hello?” I said, my voice too loud in the contained space.

The scuffling stopped. The breathing hitched.

I took a slow step forward. “I’m not going to hurt you. I… I found the bag.”

A shape detached itself from the blackness. Small, hunched. It was a boy. He looked to be eight, maybe nine. He was soaked to the skin, his hair plastered to his forehead. He wore only one sock. His eyes were wide, but they were not focused on me. They were focused on a point somewhere past my shoulder, at nothing. In his arms, he clutched a sodden, filthy bundle of brown and white fur. A puppy. It was shivering, a continuous, pathetic tremor.

“He fell,” the boy whispered. His voice was scraped raw. “In the water. I got him out. But I can’t find my sister. She ran. She was scared.”

The hum in my chest split again. The boy and his puppy were one source—the warm, confused frequency. The sister was the other—the sharp, panicked signal that led to the *longkang*. The thread was between them. And it was stretching thin.

“What’s your name?” I asked, kneeling slowly, bringing myself to his level.

“Kai,” he said. He didn’t look at me.

“Kai. My name is… it doesn’t matter. Your sister. Which way did she run?”

He lifted a trembling hand and pointed back towards the service road, towards the channel. “She was crying. She slipped. Then she was gone.” He said it flatly, as if describing something from a television show. The shock had sanded the edges off his terror.

Gone. Not into the water. The signal did not come from the water itself. It came from the *conduit*. The culvert was a throat. It led somewhere.

The puppy whined, a thin, reedy sound. Kai clutched it tighter. “My Amah will be angry. We weren’t supposed to be out. We were looking for him.” He nuzzled the wet fur. “He got lost.”

Two lost things finding a third, and creating a fourth. The arithmetic of disaster.

I could not leave him. The practical part of my mind, the London part, screamed to call the police, to hand this over to the competent, the official. But the hum knew better. The police would come with lights and noise and questions. They would trample the signal. They would not understand that the sister was not just a girl in a drain; she was a point of active resonance in a territory that was awake and hungry. By the time they mapped their search grids, the thread would have dissolved. She would become a parcel of land, to be tended in decades to come.

I took out my phone. I had no numbers for emergencies here. Only one contact felt remotely appropriate. I scrolled and pressed call on Meng’s number. He answered on the second ring, his voice alert, devoid of sleep.

“You have a reading,” he said. It was not a question.

“A fresh one. A child. In the Toa Payoh drains. Her brother is with me. He’s in shock. I need you to come. Quietly.”

He was silent for a beat. I heard the rustle of fabric, the jingle of keys. “Location. Now.”

I sent him the pin. “There’s a puppy,” I added, uselessly.

“Keep the boy warm. Do not let him follow you. I am ten minutes away.” The line went dead.

I turned to Kai. “A friend is coming. A good friend. He will take care of you and…” I looked at the puppy. “What’s his name?”

“Xiao Bai,” Kai murmured.

“He will take care of you and Xiao Bai. He will bring you home.”

Kai’s eyes finally flickered to mine. The confusion in them was a physical pain. “But Mei… I have to find Mei.”

“I will look,” I said. The words were stones in my mouth. “I am good at looking in dark places.”

It was the wrong thing to say. His face crumpled. “It’s very dark.”

Meng arrived in eight minutes. He did not come in a car. He came on a small, silent electric scooter, gliding to a halt on the footpath. He was dressed in dark, practical clothing. He carried a small duffel bag. He took in the scene—the boy, the puppy, the spilled school bag, my own haunted face—with a single, sweeping glance. He did not ask for details. He went straight to Kai, kneeling, his voice a low, steady murmur in Mandarin. He produced a foil blanket from his bag and wrapped it around the boy’s shoulders. He examined the puppy with gentle, efficient hands.

“Mild hypothermia, for both,” he said to me, his tone clinical. “No major injury. The shock is the greater concern.” He looked up at me, his eyes reflecting the flickering lamp. “You are following the thread.”

“It’s pulling towards the culvert. But not from inside it. From beyond it. It’s… a path.”

He nodded. He placed a hand on Kai’s head. “Stay with me, little brother. Your friend is going to find a way to bring Mei back to the path. You must hold this end for her. Can you do that? Hold the end of the string?”

Kai, mesmerised by Meng’s calm authority, nodded weakly.

Meng looked back at me. He reached into his duffel and pulled out a heavy-duty flashlight, a compact first-aid kit, and a small, zippered pouch. He handed them to me. “The drainage system here is a map from the 1970s. It connects to the old *longkang* network, then to the monsoon canal. It is a small world underneath. But it is easy to become a ghost in it. Do not lose the hum. If the thread snaps while you are in there, you will be lost with her.” He paused. “The box. Is it quiet?”

I shrugged off my backpack, felt the solid weight of the wooden box. The old, mapped silence within was dormant, a sleeping beast. It did not react to this new, frantic signal. “It’s quiet.”

“Good. Two frequencies will confuse you. Follow the new one. The fresh one. It is brighter. It will burn out faster.” He zipped his bag. “Go. I have this.”

There was no blessing, no good luck. There was only an allocation of tasks. I turned from the light, from the boy and the man and the shivering puppy, and walked back towards the swallowing dark of the culvert.

The hum was a compass needle now, spinning in my chest and then locking, pointing straight into the black mouth. I switched on the flashlight. The beam cut through the drizzle, illuminating the rushing brown water as it vanished into the pipe. The grate was the only way. I tested it with my hand. The torn section was sharp, but it offered a gap just wide enough to squeeze through if I went into the water.

There was no way to do it dry. I took a breath, the smells of wet and rust and decay filling my nostrils. I slung the backpack high on my shoulders, clutched the flashlight, and stepped off the edge into the channel.

The water was shockingly cold, a grip around my thighs that stole my breath. The current tugged insistently at my legs. I waded the few feet to the broken grate, turned sideways, and pushed myself through the jagged opening. My shirt caught and ripped. A sharp pain scored my ribs. Then I was through, inside the culvert.

The world changed. The sound of the city vanished, replaced by the hollow, echoing roar of water flowing in a tube. The air was cold and still and stank of stagnation. My flashlight beam danced over curved concrete walls slick with algae, over the arching ceiling where roots had pushed through, dangling like thin, white nerves. The water here was waist-deep, moving with a stronger, smoother force. The hum was not ahead of me. It was *around* me. The signal was not a point; it was a smear. She had been here, her panic rubbing off on the walls, soaking into the water.

I began to wade upstream, against the current. It was hard, slogging work. The concrete underfoot was slippery. Every ten yards, a shaft of faint, grey light pierced the darkness from a drain cover above, checkering the water with fleeting, ghostly patterns. I passed intersections where smaller pipes vomited their streams into the main flow. The hum would falter at these junctions, then strengthen, pulling me always to the left, taking the larger, older branch.

I lost track of time. There was only the cold, the resistance, the roar, and the humming wire in my core. I was a stitch being drawn through the city’s underside. I thought of the map in my jacket, dry for now, a representation of the world above. It was useless here. This was the negative space, the territory between addresses, given physical form.

The pipe began to slope upwards. The water grew shallower, rushing around my knees. The air grew slightly warmer, carrying a new smell—damp earth, rotting vegetation. The concrete gave way to older, rougher brick, then to stone. I was entering an older layer. The hum grew clearer, sharper. The panic was crystallising into something else: exhaustion, a fading pulse.

The tunnel opened abruptly into a wider space. My flashlight beam failed to find a ceiling. I was in a cavern, a forgotten underground chamber where several streams converged. The water pooled here, black and seemingly still, before draining away through another, lower pipe. The chamber was built of massive, mossy stones. It was not a modern construction. It felt ancient, a secret cistern.

And there, on a narrow, dry ledge of stone along one wall, was a small, huddled form.

Mei.

She was curled into a ball, her arms wrapped around her knees. She was soaked, her clothes plastered to her tiny frame. She was not moving.

The hum in my chest did not crescendo. It changed. The sharp panic was gone. What remained was a faint, fading ember of self. A tiny, quiet hum of *here I am*.

“Mei,” I said, softly. The chamber swallowed my voice.

She did not stir.

I waded through the stagnant pool to the ledge. The water was chest-deep here, unnervingly warm in patches, cold in others. I hauled myself onto the stone. It was slick with moss. I crawled to her.

“Mei. Your brother Kai is safe. Xiao Bai is safe.”

A tremor went through her. Slowly, very slowly, she uncurled. Her face was pale, streaked with dirt and tears. She looked at me, but her eyes were like her brother’s had been—seeing something else, something in the space just behind the world.

“The lady,” she whispered, her voice a dry leaf rustle. “The lady in the water told me to wait here.”

A cold that had nothing to do with the damp seized my spine. “What lady?”

Mei’s gaze drifted past me, to the black pool. “She had long hair. All around her like seaweed. She was very cold. She said to wait. She said someone would come. A map-man.” She blinked, slowly. “Are you the map-man?”

The hum in me stuttered. I followed her gaze to the water. My flashlight beam played over the surface. It was opaque, a sheet of black glass. But the hum… I focused. Underneath Mei’s fading signal, so deep I had almost mistaken it for the stone itself, was another frequency. Vast. Slow. Cold as the deep earth. It was the silence of the box in my backpack, but older, wetter, and not contained. It was the silence of the aquifer, of the bedrock. It was the lady in the water.

This territory was not just alive. It was inhabited.

“I’m a friend,” I managed to say, my throat tight. “I’m here to bring you back to the path. Kai is holding the string for you.”

The word ‘string’ seemed to register. She nodded, a tiny, mechanical motion. “I’m cold.”

I opened the first-aid kit Meng had given me. There was another foil blanket. I wrapped it around her. She was light, a bundle of bird bones. “I need to carry you, Mei. We have to go back through the water.”

She didn’t protest. She let me lift her, settling her on my hip. She clung to my neck, her head resting on my shoulder. Her small hum vibrated against my chest, a counter-rhythm to my own.

I slid back into the pool, holding her high. Turning, I cast the flashlight beam one last time around the chamber. On the far wall, where the stone met the water, I saw it. Not a carving. A stain. A dark, mineral deposit that had formed over decades, perhaps centuries, into a shape. It was vague, flowing. It could have been a trick of the light and the moss. It could have been a woman with hair streaming out around her.

The deep, cold hum from the water did not rise. It did not threaten. It simply was. A presence. A keeper of this underground node. It had not harmed the girl. It had told her to wait.

*Someone would come. A map-man.*

The territory was not just calling. It was expecting.

The journey back was a blur of strain and terror. Carrying Mei, fighting the current, the flashlight clenched in my teeth. The hum was our guide, but it was weakening in her, guttering like a candle in a draft. My own strength was leaching away into the cold water. Twice I slipped, going under, swallowing a mouthful of foulness, holding Mei above the surface with a desperation that burned in my muscles.

When I finally saw the faint grey light of the drain cover near the broken grate, it was like a vision of heaven. I pushed through the opening, back into the channel behind the HDB blocks, and collapsed onto the grass verge, Mei still clutched in my arms.

The rain had stopped. The sky was the colour of charcoal, the pre-dawn bleed. The world was quiet.

Meng was there. He had Kai wrapped in a second blanket, sitting on his scooter’s seat. Xiao Bai was tucked inside Kai’s jacket, only a small, sleepy head visible. Meng’s eyes met mine. He saw the state of us, saw the look on my face. He said nothing. He simply took Mei from my arms, checking her pulse, her breathing, wrapping her more securely. She murmured, “Kai?”

Her brother scrambled over, his face a mask of tear-streaked relief. He didn’t speak. He just put his hand on her blanket-covered foot.

Meng helped me up. My legs were numb. He handed me a thermos. Sweet, hot tea. It burned all the way down, anchoring me back into my body.

“The authorities are not involved,” Meng said quietly, as he settled Mei on the scooter with Kai, making a nest of blankets around them. “I will take them home. A story of a lost puppy and a fall in the park. It will be believed. The mother is a nurse on the night shift. She will be home soon.” He looked at me. “You saw something else.”

“The territory…” I began, my teeth chattering. “It’s not empty.”

He held my gaze for a long moment, then nodded, as if I had confirmed something he long suspected. “The map is not just of places. It is of presences. You have met one.”

“It knew I would come.”

“Of course,” he said, his voice almost gentle. “You are the needle. The needle is drawn to the tears. The weaver of the territory knows its own tools.” He started the scooter, a near-silient whirr. “Go home. Clean the cut on your ribs. The boy’s sandals, the bag… I will handle it. You have done the work. The thread is re-knit.”

He guided the scooter onto the path, the two small blanket-wrapped figures leaning against him. They disappeared around a corner, back into the waking world.

I stood alone on the grass, dripping, shivering. The hum was gone. Both of them. Mei’s small signal had faded as she reconnected with her brother. The deep, cold hum of the chamber was out of range, back in its stone and water.

But the silence it left behind was not empty. It was pregnant. *You are the needle.*

I walked back to the main road, a spectre in soaked, torn clothes. The first bus of the morning was idling at a stop. I boarded it, drawing stares from the cleaner on his way to work. I didn’t care.

Back at the shophouse, in the grey dawn light, I peeled off my filthy clothes. The cut on my ribs was long but shallow. I cleaned it, the sting a bright, clean pain. I showered until the hot water ran out, scrubbing at the smell of the drain.

In my room, I opened my backpack. The wooden box was there, cool and silent. I placed it on the desk. I took out the map, still dry in its plastic sleeve. My hands were steady as I unrolled it.

I did not mark the chamber in Toa Payoh. I did not need to. It was not a parcel to be tended. It was a node. A presence. And I knew, with a certainty that settled in my bones like a sediment, that it was not the only one.

The map was not a record of solved silences. It was an index of inhabitants.

My phone, charging on the floor, buzzed. Not a message. A calendar notification, one I had not set.

It was for today. 11:00 AM. *The address: 22 Amber Road. The custodians are ready.*

Below the notification, a single line of text appeared, as if typed by the air itself.

*The needle must meet the weaver.*

## **Chapter 22**

The notification on my phone was a cold, bright eye in the dim room. It held none of the ambiguity of Auntie Li’s missing frog, none of the cryptic poetry of the old man’s warnings. It was an appointment. A summons. The text hovered, a line of pure statement against the digital white. *The needle must meet the weaver.*

The map lay before me, a landscape of my own making. The marks were no longer just Xs. They were notations. The red pin in Bukit Brown was a vigil. The blue cross in Tiong Bahru was a suture. The chamber in Toa Payoh, unmarked, was a deep, cold pressure on the paper, a watermark of presence I could feel through the desk. The map was no longer a guide. It was a diagnosis. And this new address, 22 Amber Road, was a point of incision.

I dressed in clean, dark clothes. The cut on my ribs pulled, a tight, clean reminder. I placed the wooden box in the centre of the map, my two silent tools. The bus ride to the East Coast was a study in contrast. The sky was a hard, tropical blue, scrubbed clean of the night’s storm. The light was brutal, revealing. It showed the cracks in the pavement, the faded paint on bus-stop benches, the determined green of trees fighting through concrete. This was the waking world, solid and indifferent. But beneath its drumming rhythm, I could now hear the other score. The low hum of a transformer was not just electricity; it was a strained chord. The distant wail of a siren was a thin, searching thread. The world had become a palimpsest, and I was learning to read the older, fainter text beneath.

Amber Road was a quiet stretch of landed houses nestled between the roar of the parkway and the whisper of the sea. Number 22 was not a shophouse, not an HDB block. It was a *black-and-white*, a colonial-era bungalow, crouched behind a screen of rain trees and ferns. Its timber frame was white, peeling. Its roof was dark terracotta tile. It looked asleep, abandoned to the humidity and the roots that pressed against its foundations. But the gate, wrought iron and heavy, was not rusted shut. It swung inward at my touch, its hinge issuing a long, low groan that was less sound and more vibration, a bass note felt in the teeth.

The path to the door was paved with moss-slicked bricks. The garden was not tended, but it was not wild. It was *occupied*. Clumps of ginger flower grew in deliberate, too-perfect circles. A stand of bamboo formed a dense, whispering wall that blocked the view of the neighbours. The air here was different. It was still, thick, layered. The salt from the sea was there, and the damp earth, and over it all, the cloying, funeral-parlour sweetness of *cempaka* blossoms. No bird sang.

The front door was teak, black with age. There was no bell. As I raised my hand to knock, the door opened.

The woman who stood there was old, but her age was not a diminishment. It was an accumulation, like the layers of nacre on a pearl. Her hair was a cloud of white, held back by a simple jade pin. She wore a *cheongsam* of dove-grey silk, unadorned. Her eyes were the colour of weak tea, and they held no surprise.

“You are punctual,” she said. Her voice was dry, precise, the accent an old Singapore, one of dictionaries and strict grammar. “Come in. They are waiting.”

The ‘they’ hung in the air. I stepped over the threshold.

The interior was a shock of cool, dim space after the hammering light outside. It was not furnished like a home. It was a repository. The high ceilings were lost in shadow. Wooden cabinets, dark and glass-fronted, lined the walls, filled with indistinct shapes: ceramic jars, rolled scrolls, tarnished metal instruments. The air smelled of camphor, sandalwood, and the faint, metallic tang of old ink. In the centre of the wide, empty room was a single, long table of polished *chengal* wood. Around it sat three other people.

An old Malay man in a crisp, white *songkok* and a light grey *baju*. His hands, resting on the table, were maps of veins and tendons. A Indian woman, perhaps in her sixties, her silver hair in a severe bun, a deep red *bindi* like a drop of blood on her forehead. And a younger Chinese man, my age perhaps, wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, his expression carefully, professionally blank.

The woman who let me in glided to the head of the table. “Sit,” she said, indicating the empty chair at the foot.

I sat. The wooden box in my backpack felt suddenly heavy, a lodestone. The map in its tube was a scroll of accusations.

“I am Mdm. Lim,” the woman said. She did not gesture to the others. “You have been busy. You have visited the quiet places. You have spoken to the guardians. You have… intervened.” She said the last word as if it were a clinical term, with neither approval nor disapproval.

“The old man at the dragon kiln,” I said. My voice sounded too loud in the hushed room. “He said you were custodians.”

The Malay man nodded once. “We are. Of the territory. Not of the places themselves. The places have their own keepers. The frog, the potter, the *pakcik* in the forest. We are the weavers.” He tapped a long finger on the table. “The map, please.”

It was not a request. I unzipped my backpack, withdrew the plastic tube, and slid out the map. I unrolled it on the table, using the wooden box at one corner and an empty teacup at another to hold it flat. The four of them leaned forward, not with curiosity, but with the focused attention of surgeons viewing a scan.

The Indian woman, her eyes sharp behind her glasses, traced a line from Bukit Brown to Tiong Bahru with a fingernail. “Clean work. A little rough at the edges, but the thread is whole.” She looked at me. “You used the silence as a guide. Not as a weapon. This is good.”

“What is this?” I asked, my hand sweeping over the map. “What are these… nodes? These presences?”

The younger man spoke for the first time. His voice was quiet, measured. “Singapore is a young country built on very old land. The stories here are deep. Some are sleeping. Some are… restless. Some are wounded. The silences you hear, the hums you feel—they are the symptoms. A healthy story is quiet, integrated. It hums at a frequency that sustains. A broken one screams, or it goes cold. It creates a tear in the territory.”

Mdm. Lim took over. “Our work is maintenance. We monitor. We listen. When a thread frays, we send a needle to re-knit it. The guardians—the local keepers—they are the fabric. We are the hands that repair.”

“And the boy? Mei?” The questions were piling up in my throat. “The chamber in Toa Payoh?”

“A complication,” the Malay man said, his face grave. “The boy was a sensitive. He heard the call of a wounded, hungry story—the thing in the chamber. It was using his grief for his sister as a bridge, a way to taste the waking world. You were the needle drawn to that tear. You reconnected the living thread—the sibling bond—and it strengthened the fabric enough to push the presence back into its node. For now.”

“It’s not gone.”
“No,” said the Indian woman. “Such things are rarely gone. They are managed. Contained. Or, in very rare cases, reconciled. Your intervention was a temporary suture. The weaver—the entity in the chamber—is still there. It is aware of you now.”

A cold trickle, unrelated to the room’s cool air, went down my spine. *You are the needle.*

“Why me?” The hollow ringing I’d felt at Spottiswoode Park was back, but it was filled now with a dreadful, specific gravity. “I didn’t ask for this. I just… heard things.”

Mdm. Lim’s tea-coloured eyes held mine. “You did not ask. But you came. You unmoored yourself. You arrived at a place of waiting, empty enough to be filled. The territory is a living system. It seeks balance. When a needle is needed, it calls one. Sometimes it is one of us, trained from youth.” She glanced at the young man. “Sometimes, it is a stranger who arrives at the right moment, hollowed out by their own life, perfectly shaped to hold the point.”

The revelation was not dramatic. It was osmotic. It seeped into the spaces between my bones. My leaving London, the hollow jet lag, the search for a story—it had not been an escape. It had been a vector. I had been called. I was a tool that had walked to the hand that needed it.

“The calendar notification,” I said. “You sent it.”
“The territory sent it,” corrected the young man. “We merely facilitate the interface. You had reached a threshold. The initial… adjustments were complete. You needed context. Purpose. Otherwise, the knowing would drive you mad, or make you dangerous.”

I looked at their faces, this council of weavers in their silent house. They were not benevolent mentors. They were mechanics. Archivists. They spoke of stories and territories with the detached passion of engineers discussing a complex, fragile machine.

“What do you want from me?” My voice was flat.
“A choice,” Mdm. Lim said. She placed both her palms flat on the table. “You can walk out of this house. We will give you something—a tea, a ritual—that will dampen your sensitivity. The hums will fade. The silences will become just silence. You will live in the single-layered world. You will forget the texture of the map. You will be safe.”

The word *safe* hung in the camphor-scented air. It felt small. Brittle.
“Or?” I asked.
“Or,” said the Malay man, “you pick up your needle. You learn its weight, its purpose. You become an active thread in the weave. You help us maintain the balance. You repair what is broken, and guard against what seeks to break in.”

“It is not a gentle path,” the Indian woman warned. “You have seen a fraction. The territories are not all sad children and lonely spirits. There are older hungers. There are tears that do not want to be mended. There is a cost to holding the point.”

I looked down at my map. At my mark in Bukit Brown, where I had simply listened. At the blue cross in Tiong Bahru, where I had followed a thread of sound to its source. At the unmarked, cold weight of Toa Payoh, where I had been used as a tool by a will greater than my own. The map was no longer a mystery to be solved. It was a work order.

I had spent my life collecting other people’s stories, holding them at arm’s length, shaping them into narratives that were neat, that had arcs. Here was a story that was raw, unshaped, and alive. It was not something to be written about. It was something to be *done*.

I did not feel brave. I felt resigned. I felt, for the first time since arriving in this humid, drumming city, a sense of dreadful fit.

“The chamber,” I said, meeting Mdm. Lim’s gaze. “The weaver there. It’s aware of me. If I walk away, what happens?”

The young man answered. “It may lose interest. Or, it may perceive you as an unfinished connection, a loose end. It could try to pull the thread from a distance. Your dampened sensitivity would make you deaf to its approach. You would be vulnerable.”

So there was no real choice. Not really. Safety was an illusion they offered out of courtesy. The path forked, but both roads led into the same dark wood. One, I walked blind. The other, I walked with a needle in my hand.

I reached out and touched the cool, silent wood of my box. I thought of the old potter’s hands, guiding the scooter into the dawn. I thought of Mei’s small, cold hand in mine, and the profound rightness of her brother’s grip replacing it. That was the work. Not the mystery, not the fear. The re-knitting.

“I’ll stay,” I said. The words were not grand. They were an admission.

Mdm. Lim gave a slow, single nod. No smile. No welcome. Acknowledgment. “Then the apprenticeship begins now. You are not a student. You are a probationary needle. You will assist. You will learn. You will be tested.” She gestured to the young man. “This is Arjun. He will be your primary contact. Your… handler.”

Arjun offered the faintest of nods. His eyes were assessing, calculating my weight, my density.

The Malay man, whom they called Pak Ali, rolled up my map with practised ease. “This is now a working document. You will update it after every engagement. Not with your feelings. With data. Location, time, nature of the disturbance, action taken, result. Clarity is your shield.”

The Indian woman, Dr. Sharma, stood. “Come. Your first lesson is in perception. You have heard silences and hums. Now you must learn to listen to the *texture* of a place. To diagnose before you prescribe.”

For the next three hours, they schooled me. It was not esoteric. It was brutally practical. Dr. Sharma taught me to distinguish between the benign ‘sleeping’ silence of an old, settled spirit and the predatory ‘hungry’ silence of something like the chamber. Pak Ali showed me, using a series of old, hand-drawn diagrams, how human emotion—particularly concentrated grief, anger, or fear—could strain the local territory, creating thin spots, making it vulnerable. Arjun spoke of logistics: safe houses, code phrases, how to access certain restricted areas without drawing official attention.

Mdm. Lim watched, interjecting only occasionally to refine a point. “You are a tool,” she said once, cutting off my question about the origin of the entities. “A plumber does not need to know the history of the water to fix a leak. He needs to know the pipe, the wrench, the sealant. Know your tools. Know the fabric. The rest is philosophy, and philosophy will not stop a territory from unravelling.”

As the afternoon light began to slant through the high, dusty windows, painting bars of gold across the dark floor, Mdm. Lim rose. “Enough. Theory is a skeleton. It needs the flesh of practice.” She looked at Arjun. “There is the matter in Geylang. The *dangdut* club. The reports are consistent. A cold spot that moves. Patrons feel a… draining. Followed by irrational rage. Two fights last week, severe. The local keeper is concerned.”

Arjun stood, smooth and efficient. “The music is loud. The emotions are high. It is a rich feeding ground for a certain type of fragment.” He looked at me. “You will observe. You will listen. You will not intervene unless I instruct. Understood?”

I nodded. The weight of the box in my backpack felt different now. It was no longer a found object. It was issued equipment.

We left the black-and-white house as quietly as we had entered. The garden’s *cempaka* scent was cloying in the late heat. The world outside the gate seemed louder, cruder, a blinding barrage of sensation. But I could now see the seams. I could feel, like a faint static on my skin, the larger, quieter grid overlaid upon it.

Arjun drove a nondescript silver sedan. He did not speak as we navigated towards Geylang. The silence was not uncomfortable; it was operational.

“The custodians,” I said finally, as we stopped at a traffic light. “How many of you are there?”
“Enough,” he said. “We are not an organisation. We are a function. Some, like the elders, are full-time. Others, like me, have lives in the world. We are called when needed.”

“And the territories… the stories. Are they all… dangerous?”
“No. Most are just old. Sad, sometimes. Lonely. They are part of the landscape. We only intervene when they become parasitic, or when the living world threatens to destroy them and create a backlash. Balance.” He said the word like a mantra.

Geylang in the late afternoon was a beast stirring from its sleep. The neon signs for lor mee and frog leg porridge were still off, but the shops were open, and the rhythmic clatter of mahjong tiles from upstairs windows provided a percussive backdrop. Arjun parked down a side lane behind a row of shophouses whose backs were stained with water leakage and the ghostly outlines of removed air-con units.

“The club is through there,” he said, pointing to a narrow alley between two buildings. “It opens at nine. The effects are reported to start around eleven, peak at one. We go in early. We find a corner. We listen.”

We entered through a back door that Arjun unlocked with a key from a large, jangling ring. The interior of the club was a cave of velvet and cheap chrome. It smelled of stale beer, industrial cleaner, and beneath it, a sour note of old sweat and spilled sweetness. The air was cold from overworked air-conditioning. A stage stood empty at one end, a glittering disco ball hanging above it like a dormant chrysalis.

“Here,” Arjun said, choosing a booth in a corner far from the stage, with a good view of the main floor and the long bar. “Order a drink. Sit. Listen. Tell me what you feel. Not what you think. What you *feel* in your bones, in your teeth.”

We sat. A bored waitress took our order for two Tigers. When they came, condensation beading on the bottles, I tried to settle into the space. I closed my eyes, letting the obvious sounds recede: the hum of the fridge, the distant kitchen noises, the thump of bass from the club next door.

At first, there was just the blank, empty silence of a place not yet alive. A waiting room. Then, as I tuned deeper, I began to feel the residues. Flickers of past laughter, sharp and bright like splintered glass. The low, throbbing ache of countless nights of loneliness. A greasy smear of desperation. These were not entities; they were echoes, emotional stains on the fabric of the place.

And then I found it. Not a sound. A *suck*.

It was in the far corner, near the fire exit. A patch of space that felt… thin. Insatiable. It wasn’t cold, like the chamber. It was numb. It pulled at the edges of my awareness, a gentle, relentless drain. I opened my eyes.

“There,” I whispered, nodding towards the corner. “Near the exit. It’s hungry. Not for attention. For… feeling. For heat.”

Arjun followed my gaze, his expression unchanged. “Good. That is the fragment. It is a leech. It attaches itself to places of high, unguarded emotion and feeds on the spillage. The fights happen because it drains the joy, the social warmth, leaving only the raw, irritable nerves beneath. People become dry tinder.”

“How do you fix it?”
“You don’t *fix* a leech. You remove it. You give it a better target.”
From his jacket pocket, he withdrew a small, polished brass vessel, like a tiny urn, sealed with a wax stopper. He placed it on the table. “This contains a concentrated charge of *sehnsucht*—wistful longing. A potent, bittersweet emotion. We will lure it, trap it, and release it in a neutral territory where it can dissipate slowly, harmlessly.”

The club began to fill. The lights dimmed, and coloured spots began to sweep the dance floor. The music started, a pounding, infectious *dangdut* rhythm. The air grew thick with bodies, perfume, cigarette smoke, and the rising tide of released energy. Laughter, shouts, the clink of glasses. The emotional temperature soared.

And the numb, sucking patch in the corner began to move.

It was slow, drifting like an oil slick on water. It would hover near a group of laughing men, and their laughter would become just a touch too loud, too forced, then die into bickering. It would pass by a couple, and their intimate whispers would turn into sharp, hissed arguments. I could see it now, not with my eyes, but as a distortion in the fabric of the room, a lens that warped warmth into friction.

“Now,” Arjun said, his voice low. He unstoppered the brass vessel.

Nothing visible emerged. But I felt it. A wave of profound, aching sweetness, a memory of a lost home you never had. It was beautiful and devastating. Arjun placed the open vessel on the floor by our booth.

The leech-fragment halted its drift across the room. It seemed to tremble, to orient itself. The sucking sensation intensified, now focused, single-minded. It began to flow across the floor, a hungry current, towards the source of the rich, melancholic feast.

As it reached the vessel, the air around it seemed to contract. The sounds from the nearby dancers muted, as if heard through glass. The fragment poured itself into the small brass opening, a silent, greedy ingestion. Arjun leaned down swiftly and pressed the wax stopper back in place with a firm, final click.

The effect was immediate. The numb pressure vanished. The club’s atmosphere didn’t become joyful, but the irritant was gone. The emotions in the room were just human emotions again, volatile but not poisoned. A couple who had been scowling at each other blinked, shook their heads, and shared a confused, then genuine, smile.

“Clean extraction,” Arjun said, pocketing the vessel. “Observation period is over. We go.”

We left through the back alley. The night air of Geylang was a relief, a chaotic but honest assault of smells and sounds. In the car, Arjun was silent for a long moment.

“You perceived it correctly. You diagnosed its nature. This is good.” He started the engine. “But perception is the smallest part. The next time, you will hold the vessel. You will choose the moment. You will seal the catch.”

He drove me back to Spottiswoode Park. As I got out, he handed me a small, blank notebook. “For your data. Start with tonight. Objective details only.” He looked at me, and for a second, the professional mask slipped, revealing something tired, something old. “The map is not a record of your journey. It is a ledger of your debts. Remember that.”

He drove away, leaving me standing under the five-foot way. The shophouse was dark. The street was quiet. I climbed the stairs to my room, my mind buzzing with protocols and perceptions, with the feel of that sucking numbness and the clever, cruel beauty of the bait.

I sat at my desk. I opened the notebook. I wrote:
*Location: Geylang, Dangdut Club “Rindu”. Time: 2100-2300. Disturbance: Mobile emotional leech-fragment, feeding on social heat, causing agitation. Action: Lured with concentrated wistfulness (vessel #4), contained. Result: Fragment neutralized, atmosphere normalized.*

The words were dry. Clinical. They contained nothing of the pounding music, the smell of spilled beer, the couple’s reconciling smile. This was the work. The reduction of experience to data.

I looked at my map, still on the desk where Pak Ali had left it. I took a blue pencil—for contained entities—and made a small, precise mark at the location of the club. Not an X. A circle. Contained.

The map was indeed a ledger. And I had just entered my first official transaction.

I lay in bed, the cut on my ribs a faint, familiar ache. The silence of my room was no longer just an absence of sound. It was a canvas. I could feel the gentle, sleeping hum of the shophouse itself, the residual warmth of Auntie Li’s family history in the walls. I could feel the distant, sleeping nodes marked on my map, each a different texture, a different pressure. And I could feel, like a bruise on the edge of my awareness, the cold, deep presence in Toa Payoh. The weaver. Aware of me.

I was no longer a spectator, a collector of stories. I was a participant. A needle, now in the hand of weavers. The apprenticeship had begun. The work was endless. And as I drifted towards sleep, the last thought that coiled through my mind was not of leeches or fragments, but of Mdm. Lim’s words, spoken with the weight of a verdict.

*Philosophy will not stop a territory from unravelling.*

But something would. And that something, now, included me. The weight of it was immense. It was the only thing that felt real.

My phone, on the bedside table, lit up. Not a calendar alert. A message from an unknown number. Arjun.

*Tomorrow. 3 PM. Meet at the old Bidadari cemetery gates. A vigil has gone silent. We need to hear why.*

Below the text, as if the territory itself was dictating the terms, my calendar updated automatically. An appointment, solid and unmovable, in the world of glass and light.

The needle had been threaded. The next stitch was waiting.

# Chapter 23

## **Chapter 23**

The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. But the rain in Bidadari was a memory. It fell as a kind of atmospheric echo, a dampness in the soil that had no business being there, a chill that clung to the bones long after the sun had baked the city’s concrete. The old cemetery gates were not gates at all, but a suggestion. Two moss-stained pillars of whitewashed brick, standing sentinel over a carpet of manicured grass. The graves were gone, exhumed, the land sleeping now between lives. It was a territory of silence, but not an empty one. It was a silence that listened.

I stood at the threshold, my shadow a stark, short thing in the afternoon glare. The map was a weight in my bag, not paper, but in my mind. I could feel the nodes: the cold anchor in Toa Payoh, the quiet hum of my shophouse, the newly-circled club in Holland Village. And here, a different texture. A muffled quality. A vigil gone silent. I understood the terminology now. A vigil was a story held in place by collective attention, a candle-flame of narrative kept burning to mark a loss, a hope, a protest. For it to go silent was not for people to leave. It was for the story to be un-told, the memory-hole to open, and for the leeches to begin their slow, patient work of consumption.

Arjun was already there, leaning against one of the pillars. He looked carved from the same weathered stone. His usual sharpness was blunted, his eyes not scanning but settled, heavy.

“You felt it,” he said. It wasn’t a question.

I nodded. The air tasted of cut grass and disturbed earth. “It’s not just quiet. It’s… padded.”

“A soundproof room,” he said, pushing off the pillar. “They set up a vigil here three weeks ago. For a child. A hit-and-run on the adjacent road. The driver never stopped. The parents, they came every evening. Lit a candle. Told stories. Passers-by would stop. Leave a toy. A note. The story was being held. It was a small, sad knot, but it was tight.”

He began walking onto the grass, and I followed. Our footsteps were swallowed by the soft ground.

“And then?” I asked, though I could feel the ‘then’ in the air. A residue of something sweet turned sour.

“Four days ago, the parents stopped coming. The candles, the toys, the notes… they remained. But the story left. The ritual became just objects. Then yesterday, the objects were gone, too. City cleanup, supposedly. But the silence that moved in wasn’t the silence of absence. It was the silence of a finished meal.”

We stopped in the centre of the field. There was nothing to see. No scorch mark, no depression in the grass. But the space between my shoulder blades itched. This was a site of erasure. A story had been carefully, surgically removed. Not fragmented, not shattered, but extracted. The precision of it was more frightening than any chaotic unraveling I’d witnessed.

“A weaver’s work,” I said, my voice low.

Arjun’s jaw tightened. “This signature is… clinical. The vigil was a tender thing. To unpick it without a single thread snapping? That takes a cold, steady hand. The opposite of a fragment’s hunger. This is curation. This is archiving.”

The thought was ice in my gut. “They’re not just containing eruptions. They’re collecting the stories.”

He looked at me, and his gaze was a confirmation. “The map is a ledger. You understood that. But a ledger records debits and credits. What is the currency? What is the balance being sought?”

The spiritual seeking, once a passive, aching hunger in me, was now a focused dread. I was not seeking meaning. I was auditing it. I was standing in a blank space where meaning had been deleted from the ledger. The philosophy of it—the why—was a luxury that crumbled here, on this sanitized grass. Mdm. Lim was right. Philosophy would not stop this. Only a more potent story could.

“We need to hear why it went silent,” I said, echoing his text. “But the parents are gone. The story is gone.”

“The story is gone,” Arjun agreed. “But the space it occupied isn’t. It’s a vacuum. And in my experience, vacuums in places like this… they record.”

He knelt, placing his palms flat on the grass. He closed his eyes. I watched the lines of his face go slack, then deepen, as if listening to a frequency pitched below hearing. This was his apprenticeship, his craft. Not needles and threads, but ears for the echoes.

I stood guard, the city’s hum a distant wall beyond the green. My own senses, raw and new, stretched out. I felt the sleeping nodes, the gentle pressures. And I felt the deep, cold presence in Toa Payoh. It was not focused here, not exactly. But it was… aware. A librarian noting a volume had been checked out.

Arjun shuddered, a full-body tremor that seemed to start from the earth and move through him. He pulled his hands back as if burned, though the grass was cool.

“Well?” I asked.

He stood, wiping his palms on his trousers. His face was pale. “It wasn’t a persuasion. It wasn’t a threat. It was a trade.”

“A trade?”

“The weaver came to them. Offered them a perfect copy of their child’s story. A clean, painless version. The driver stops. The ambulance comes. The child lives. A story of trauma, rewritten as a story of miraculous recovery. All the love, none of the grief. A sealed loop. A perfect, contained memory. In exchange, they had to relinquish the original. The true story. The vigil. The public mourning. They had to give up the ragged edges, the unanswered questions, the collective anger. They took the copy and walked away.”

The horror of it was absolute. It was not violence. It was mercy, weaponized. It was the ultimate spiritual seduction: the offer of a painless past. Who would refuse? What parent, drowning in the acid of unjust loss, would not reach for that lifeline? The weaver hadn’t stolen their story. They had bought it. With counterfeit currency.

“That’s the balance,” I whispered, the understanding a sickness in me. “They’re not just maintaining stability. They’re trading messy, painful, true stories for clean, palatable fictions. They’re rewriting the territory’s ledger. Sanitizing its history.”

Arjun nodded, grim. “And the true stories? The originals? Where do they go? What does a weaver *do* with a concentrated dose of pure, unadulterated grief?”

The answer hung in the padded silence around us. They didn’t discard them. A collector does not throw away the prize. They stored them. They used them. Fuel. Weapon. Exhibit. The purpose was still opaque, but the mechanism was now horrifically clear. The weavers were surgeons of memory, and their payment was in raw, human truth.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. Not Arjun. I pulled it out. The screen showed a notification from a local news aggregator. A headline.

**Community Joy: Toa Payoh Heritage Hub Announces "Memory Well" Installation. A digital archive of neighbourhood stories, launching this weekend.**

Below the text was a rendering: a sleek, dark plinth in the centre of the new community plaza, the one built over the old, contested ground. The plaza that sat directly above the cold, deep presence on my map. The Memory Well.

“They’re not just collecting,” I said, showing Arjun the screen. “They’re preparing to display.”

He stared at the rendering, his expression hardening into something like despair. “A well. You drop a story in. You get back… what? The sanitized version? The original becomes a data point in their archive, and the public gets the curated copy. It’s a filtration system. For the entire neighbourhood’s soul.”

The scale of it crashed down. This wasn’t about a single vigil. This was a pilot project. A proof of concept. The Bidadari extraction was a test. The Memory Well was the rollout.

“We have to stop the launch,” I said. The words felt childish, absurd. Stop a community event? With what? Our profound discomfort?

“How?” Arjun’s voice was flat. “We walk in and tell people their cherished memories are being processed into propaganda? They’ll think we’re mad. And the weavers… they are the authorities here. They are the stability. We are the fragments.”

It was the darkest moment. Every thread led to destruction. The weavers were not monsters in the shadows; they were the architects in the light, offering peace, order, clean narratives. Who would fight against that? My own role was a grotesque joke. A needle, threaded to mend tears in reality, only to discover the master weavers were the ones carefully, lovingly, unraveling the truest parts of the tapestry and replacing them with impeccable forgeries.

The spiritual seeking turned inward, a frantic pulse. What was I seeking? Not a god, not a truth. A lever. A story strong enough to challenge a perfect lie.

I thought of Auntie Li’s shophouse, its walls holding the warmth of family history, unvarnished and complete. I thought of the couple in the club, their reconciliation a private, messy truth. I thought of my own unmoored state, the bruise-coloured suitcase, the key under the frog. My story had no clean version. It was all ragged edges and unanswered questions. It was real.

“We don’t stop the launch,” I heard myself say. The idea formed like a crystal in the cold of my dread. “We contaminate it.”

Arjun looked at me. “Explain.”

“The Memory Well is a filter. It takes in true stories and outputs clean ones. What if we give it a story that can’t be cleaned? A story that’s all edge. A story that, if you try to rewrite it, unravels the rewrite.”

“A paradox,” he murmured. “A narrative fragment. But a controlled one. You want to introduce a virus.”

“Not a virus. A mirror.” The plan, desperate and half-formed, gained a terrible clarity. “The weaver in Toa Payoh. He knew my grandfather. There’s a story there, a true one, that connects to me. He’s collected so much. What if his own story—the true, messy, human story of why he does this—is fed into his own machine? What if the Memory Well is asked to process the weaver’s own grief, his own guilt?”

Arjun was silent for a long time, the memory-laden breeze stirring his hair. “It’s a suicide run. To get that story, you’d have to go to the source. To him. You’d have to walk into the heart of his territory and… what? Ask him to confess?”

“No,” I said. The seed planted in the darkness began to sprout, a sharp, thorny thing. “I don’t ask. I listen. Every story leaves a trace. You heard the echo of a trade here. His story is in the walls of that place, in the cold at the centre of his web. I’m a needle. I’m designed to find tears, to feel tensions. I’ll find the tear in *him*. The original wound he’s trying to sew over with everyone else’s stories.”

“He’ll feel you the moment you start probing,” Arjun warned. “It will be an act of war.”

“It already is,” I said, looking out at the blank, listening field of Bidadari. “He just hasn’t bothered to declare it. I’m not a soldier. I’m a loose thread. And I’m going to snag on his masterpiece.”

Arjun studied me, and I saw a shift in his eyes. From despair to a grim, resigned calculation. He saw the logic. It was the only move left on a board that was already tilted against us.

“You’ll need a distraction. For the launch event. Something to pull his attention, to thin his focus.”

“I have an idea for that, too,” I said, thinking of Mdm. Lim’s stern face, her network of taxi-uncles and coffee-shop aunties who knew the value of a story that belonged to you. “But I’ll need your help to get in. Not through the front door.”

He gave a slow, single nod. A pact, sealed on gravesite grass. “I know a way. The old storm drains. They run beneath the plaza. They were part of the territory’s old anatomy. He may have sealed them, but… seals can be broken.”

We left Bidadari as the evening began to bleed the colour from the sky. The silence followed us to the gates, then released us back into the city’s drumming hum. The return to Spottiswoode Park felt like crossing a border into a fragile ally. The shophouse welcomed me with its familiar, sleeping warmth. But it felt smaller now. A safe house on the edge of a battlefield.

I did not sleep. I sat at the desk, Pak Ali’s map before me. I took a red pencil—for active, unresolved tensions—and drew a small, careful circle around the Toa Payoh plaza. Then I drew a line, in blue, from the Bidadari pillar to it. A transaction. A credit transferred.

Then I did something I had not done before. I took a black pencil, one I had never used. And in the margin of the map, I began to write. Not coordinates. Not notations. Fragments of my own story. The bruise-coloured suitcase. The missing frog. The hollow ringing of jet lag. The smell of frangipani and wet asphalt. The unasked question of why I had really come. I wrote until the margin was a dark, messy cloud of text. My own vigil. My own true, un-sanitized story. If I was going to use myself as a mirror, I had to remember what I reflected.

The night deepened. The cut on my ribs was a silent companion. The cold presence in Toa Payoh was a constant pressure on the edge of my mind, a lighthouse in a frozen sea. I did not try to hide from it. I let my own ragged narrative hum softly, a counter-frequency.

Just before dawn, my phone lit up. A message from Mdm. Lim. No greeting.

*The old stories are the strongest. The taxi stand has a queue for the Memory Well. They are offering free rides to seniors to bring their stories. A generous offer. Too generous. My friends will be there. They will have stories to tell. They will take their time.*

A distraction. A queue of authentic, garrulous, inconvenient humanity, flooding the intake of the Well with stories too vibrant, too idiosyncratic, to be quickly processed. It was perfect.

I replied with two words. *Thank you.*

Her response was immediate. *Philosophy will not stop them. But stubbornness might.*

I put the phone down. The first grey light was tracing the window bars. The appointment in my calendar for the Memory Well launch glowed, an unblinking eye. I had until tomorrow.

The needle had been threaded with a thread of my own making. The next stitch would be an act of sabotage, sewn from the inside out. The spiritual seeking was over. I had found what I sought. It was not peace, not truth. It was a weapon. And it was myself.

I closed my eyes, not to sleep, but to listen. To feel for the tear in the world that was a man, and the story he had buried so deep he thought it was gone. Tomorrow, I would go digging. And we would see which of us was the stronger story.

# Chapter 24

## **Chapter 24**

The rain in Singapore is a solid thing. It doesn’t fall so much as it arrives, a sudden, silver wall that erases the towers of the new city and turns the world into a drum. I stood under the five-foot way of a shophouse on Amoy Street, a different covered walkway, a different space for waiting. The air smelled of wet asphalt, *kopi*, and the faint, ghostly sweetness of frangipani from a tree someone had tried to grow in a crack in the pavement. I had no suitcase. The hollow ringing in my bones was not jet lag, but the aftermath of a vigil, the residue of a story told in ink and silence. I was waiting for the rain to thin, for a break in the percussion, so I could walk the final five hundred metres to the door.

The door today was not 28B Spottiswoode Park Road. It was the glass and steel atrium of the Memory Well’s public launch, a temple of curated nostalgia. My appointment glowed in my calendar, that unblinking eye. Mdm. Lim’s message was a live wire in my pocket. *The taxi stand has a queue.* A weapon of mass inconvenience, forged from stubbornness and free rides. My own weapon was quieter, colder. It was the story I had exhumed from myself in the dark, the one I would use to dig for his.

The rain slackened from a wall to a curtain, then to a persistent mist. I stepped out into it. Let it bead on my skin. The city that had been a blur of alien humidity and sharp edges nine months ago was now a map scored into me. I knew the pressure of the cold spot in Toa Payoh like a missing tooth I could probe with my tongue. I knew the weight of the humid air in the Bukit Brown cemetery, the taste of old grief. I knew the exact timbre of silence in Mdm. Lim’s front room. This was not familiarity. It was inscription.

The atrium was a cathedral of light and sound, a deliberate assault on the senses. Holographic projections of “shared memories” danced in the air—generic celebrations, first days of school, wedding smiles that never reached the eyes. The soundscape was a susurrus of crowd noise and a saccharine, algorithmic score. It was the opposite of the five-foot way. It offered no space for waiting, only consumption. A smiling attendant in a cream-coloured tunic scanned my invitation.

“Welcome to the Well,” she said, her voice as calibrated as the music. “Your journey to deeper connection starts today.”

I moved through the crowd. It was a mix of tech investors in open-collared shirts, government officials with careful smiles, and early-adopter citizens, their faces lit by the glow of the complimentary tablets they carried, already scrolling through the promotional memory packs. I saw none of Mdm. Lim’s friends. Not yet.

He was at the centre of it all, standing on a low dais before a shimmering representation of the Well’s core—a vortex of swirling, golden light. Dr. Aris Thorne. He wore a tailored navy suit, the kind that costs more than a year of Auntie Li’s rent. His silver hair was perfect. His hands moved with a conductor’s grace as he explained the technology to a rapt circle. He spoke of legacy, of healing the fragmentation of modern life, of building a collective soul.

I watched him. I listened past the words to the rhythm beneath. The careful modulation. The pauses that were just a fraction too long, inviting admiration. This was his story, the one he had built over the buried one. A story of genius, of benevolence, of a man who had conquered personal tragedy to gift the world wholeness. The biography in all the press kits. The car accident that took his wife and young daughter. The years of grief, then the breakthrough. *From profound loss, profound connection.*

It was a good story. Clean. Sanitized. Powerful.

It was also, I now knew, a lie. Not in its facts, but in its soul. The story he had buried was not the loss. It was the moment before.

I drifted closer, a ghost in the bright room. I let my own ragged narrative hum, the one I’d scribbled in the dark. The bruise-coloured suitcase. The missing frog. The unasked question. I didn’t try to quiet it. I let it be a tuning fork, vibrating to a different frequency.

His eyes swept the room, acknowledging admirers. They passed over me, paused, and returned. A flicker, there and gone. A recognition not of my face, but of the frequency. I was a wrong note in his symphony. He gave a final, beatific smile to his circle and stepped down, making his way toward a side corridor marked ‘Private’.

I followed, not stealthily, but with the directness of someone who belonged. The corridor was quieter, lined with framed patents and awards. He stopped before a door, his keycard in hand.

“This area is for staff,” he said, without turning around. His voice was still pleasant, but it had cooled by twenty degrees.

“I know,” I said. “I wanted to see the engine room. The place where the stories get cleaned.”

He turned then. His face was a mask of polite inquiry, but his eyes were the colour of a winter sea. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. The narrative integration core is highly sensitive. The launch presentation is in the atrium. You’ll find everything you need there.”

“I doubt that.” I held his gaze. The hum inside me was louder now, a vibration in my teeth. “I think what I need is in there. In the raw intake. The stories before they’re… processed.”

A muscle in his jaw tightened. “The Well is designed to alleviate pain, not to wallow in it. We honour memory by focusing on its essence, not its trauma.”

“Whose pain?” I asked. The question hung in the sterile air of the corridor. “Whose trauma are you alleviating?”

For the first time, his composure showed a crack. A faint, vertical line appeared between his eyebrows. “Everyone’s. It’s our mission.”

“No,” I said, my voice soft. “It’s your penance.”

The word landed in the silence like a stone in a still pool. His expression didn’t change, but something behind his eyes shut down. A portcullis slamming shut.

“I don’t know who you are or what you think you’re implying,” he said, his voice now flat, metallic. “But this event is for guests, not for amateur psychoanalysis. Security can show you out.”

He raised his hand, a small remote in his grip. I spoke before he could press a button.

“It wasn’t a car accident.”

My words were barely a whisper. They didn’t need to be loud. They were a needle, and I had just found the seam.

He froze. The remote didn’t waver, but his breath caught, just once.

“The official story,” I continued, the pieces Mdm. Lim’s stubborn research and my own cold nights had unearthed clicking into place. “Rain-slicked road. Oncoming lorry. A tragedy. But the weather report for that district, that night, showed no rain. And the lorry driver’s statement… it was never released. Sealed. A private settlement, far beyond what was necessary.”

“Get out.” The words were gritted out.

“You were driving,” I said. I took a step closer. The pressure in the corridor was immense, a psychic humidity. “You weren’t drunk. The tests showed nothing. You were just… gone. A micro-sleep? A fugue? The report speculated. But you know. You were chasing a thought. A breakthrough. The kernel of the Well. You were so deep inside the architecture of memory you forgot you were piloting a ton of metal at eighty kilometres an hour. Your wife called your name. You didn’t hear her.”

“Stop.” It was not a command. It was a plea. The portcullis was bent, groaning.

“The loss wasn’t the tragedy,” I said, the truth of it cold and sharp in my mouth. “The tragedy was the moment before. The choice you made, not between family and work, but between presence and abstraction. You chose the abstraction. And they died for it.”

He made a sound, a low, wounded thing. The remote clattered to the floor. He swayed, putting a hand against the wall to steady himself. The great Dr. Aris Thorne, reduced to a man leaning on painted drywall.

“You built this,” I gestured back toward the atrium’s glow, “not to heal the world. You built it to erase that moment. To create a world where no one is ever truly present, so no one can ever be truly absent. Where memory is a filtered, collective dream, so no one has to live alone with the unforgivable specificity of their own. It’s not a Well. It’s a tomb. You’re burying them all in it with you.”

He looked at me then, truly looked. The mask was gone. What remained was ravaged, ancient. “Who are you?”

“I’m the one who found the frog,” I said, and the absurdity of it was the only truth that fit. “The key was underneath. To a different house.”

From the atrium, a swell of noise erupted. Not the algorithmic music, but real, human sound—raised, querulous voices, the sound of many people talking at once. A disturbance in the curated flow. I heard a familiar, reedy voice holding forth about the correct way to make *kaya* in 1962. Mdm. Lim’s cavalry had arrived. The queue for the Memory Well was now inside, and it was full of inconvenient, vibrant, unstoppable stories.

The distraction was perfect.

Thorne heard it too. His eyes flickered toward the noise, then back to me. The ravaged man receded; the CEO reasserted himself, but it was a cracked facade. “You can’t stop this. The funding. The approvals. The public want it.”

“I’m not trying to stop the machine,” I said. I bent down, picked up his remote, and handed it to him. Our fingers did not touch. “I’m trying to stop you from living inside it. The story you buried is the only thing that’s real about you. Everything else…” I looked past him, to the door of the core. “It’s just noise.”

I turned and walked back down the corridor, toward the cacophony of real life. I didn’t look back. I felt his gaze on me, a weight between my shoulder blades, until I merged with the crowd.

The atrium was glorious chaos. A dozen aunties and uncles from God-knows-where, dressed in their best, were holding court. They were feeding their stories into the intake terminals with deliberate, painstaking slowness, arguing with the prompts, correcting the AI’s assumptions, offering tangents upon tangents. The system was glitching, the holograms stuttering. The cream-tuniced attendants were fluttering, helpless. The pristine narrative was breaking down under the weight of lived experience.

I saw Mdm. Lim near a potted fiddle-leaf fig, sipping a glass of water. She met my eyes and gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. *Stubbornness*, her look said.

I moved through the chaos, a still point in the turning world. The spiritual seeking was over. I had not found peace. I had not found truth. I had found a reflection—a man who had tried to outrun his story by building a prison for everyone else’s. And in seeing him, I had seen the alternative. Not to run. Not to build. But to stand in the five-foot way, in the space for waiting, and hold the un-sanitized truth of your own life, however it smells of wet asphalt and grief.

I left the atrium. The rain had stopped. The sky was the colour of a fresh bruise, bleeding into twilight. The city gleamed, wet and new and old all at once. I walked without destination, feeling the cut on my ribs, a familiar companion. The cold presence in Toa Payoh was quiet now, not gone, but sated. It had been witnessed.

My phone buzzed. Not Mdm. Lim. An unknown number.

*The frog was never missing. You were looking in the wrong place. The right story finds its key when it’s ready. Come to 28B. There’s something you need to see.*

I stared at the words. The address was an incantation that had, perhaps, simply been waiting for its time. The journey was a spiral, not a circle. I was back at the beginning, but I was not the same. I had a weapon. I had a story. And I had, at last, a question worth asking.

I turned my steps toward Spottiswoode Park. The night air was cool on my skin. Somewhere behind me, in a temple of light, a flawed god was crumbling. Ahead of me, in a shophouse with a blue ceramic frog, a door was finally opening. I walked toward it, the sound of my footsteps on the damp pavement the only drum I needed. The vigil was over. The digging was done.

What remained was to go home.

# Epilogue
## The Five-Foot Way

The blue ceramic frog was there, squat and glazed in the thin morning light, one eye chipped as if winking. The key was not under it. It was in the lock of the heavy, green door, waiting to be turned.

I turned it.

The space inside was not empty. It hummed, but with a different frequency. The dust was gone, swept into the corners of memory. Sunlight, that same geometric cutter from the first day, fell across a floor now marked by the ghost-impressions of furniture long removed. A single mat remained, woven from pandan, brown and resilient. Beside it, a terracotta pot held a cutting from the ixora outside, its roots tentative in new soil.

I had not moved in. I had moved *through*. The shophouse was not a residence, but a vessel. The ghosts were not tenants, but guides. They had shown me their silences—the unsaid departure of a son for a war that wasn’t his, the unwept tears of a mother who traded jade for passage, the cold rage of a colonial clerk pressed into the grain of a desk. I had listened in the language of peeling plaster and night-blooming jasmine. Their stories were not mine to keep, but to acknowledge. In that acknowledgement, the cold presence in my ribs had dissolved, not into nothing, but into the ambient cool of stone that has learned to breathe.

My flat in Crouch End is let to a nice couple who teach at the Montessori school. They send me photos of the philodendron, now improbably lush. The British Library wrote, a polite inquiry about my sabbatical. I sent a polite resignation, my hands no longer interested in repairing the tears of other people’s pressed flowers. My own petals were too real, too fragile, and too alive to be mounted.

Mdm. Lim comes on Tuesdays. She brings *kaya* sandwiches, the toast perfectly crisp, and critiques my posture as I sit on the five-foot way. She never mentions the collapse of the Memory Well. She speaks of the weather, the price of eggs, the stubbornness of her own potted lime tree. Our friendship is a language built entirely of tangential roots. It is enough.

Sometimes, I think of Thorne. The news articles were brief, clinical. “Pioneering memory-tech firm steps back from public launch; CEO cites personal reasons.” I imagine him in some other white room, the silence now a deafening companion. I do not pity him. I recognise him. He is the road I did not take, the replica life I turned away from. His prison was of light; mine was of dust. We both found our keys in the same forgotten soil.

The shophouse holds me lightly. I own very little. A mat. A bowl. A change of clothes. A stack of notebooks filled not with my family’s history, but with my own—sketches of root structures, the names of neighbourhood cats, the quality of light at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday. The minimalism is no longer an aesthetic or an ascetic practice. It is the necessary clearing required to hear the world speak. To feel the monsoon rain coming hours before it falls, in the ache of the ceiling beams. To smell, on a still afternoon, the ghost of cloves and nutmeg from the docks a century gone.

This morning, a letter arrived. Not an email. Paper, in a cream envelope, postmarked from Kuala Lumpur. The handwriting was spidery, unfamiliar. It was from the granddaughter of the woman who had lived here before Auntie Li. She had heard, through the subterranean networks that connect diaspora aunties across borders, that I was here. She included a photograph, sepia-toned and cracked: two women on this very five-foot way, their faces turned toward the camera, their eyes holding a challenge I could feel through the paper. On the back, in fountain pen: *Her name was Lijuan. She taught my grandmother to read. Thank you for listening to the walls.*

I propped the photograph on the windowsill, where the light cuts it into bars. It did not feel like an artifact. It felt like a neighbor, dropping by.

The work I do now is small, and it is everything. I help a community group map the heritage trees in the neighborhood, not their species names, but the names given to them by the people who have lived beneath them: the Umbrella Tree, the Gossip-Pepper, the Rain-Drummer. We record the stories in their shade. It is a different kind of archive. One that breathes.

Tonight, the air is heavy with impending rain. I sit on my mat in the five-foot way, the space for waiting. The street is quiet. A bicycle leans against a lamp post. From a window upstairs, the faint scent of frying garlic.

I am not at peace. Peace is a static thing, and this place is alive with currents. I am, however, belonging. Not to a nation, or a lineage neatly charted. I belong to this specific rectangle of shadow, this particular scent of wet asphalt after rain, this chorus of gecko clicks and distant traffic. I belong to the silence that is not an absence, but a medium—thick, potent, and humming with the stories it has chosen, at last, to yield.

The first drop of rain hits the pavement with a sound like a struck bell. Then another. Then a thousand.

I do not move inside. I sit in the sheltered margin, between the private heart of the house and the public flow of the street, and let the rain fall just beyond my feet. The memory is not a well. It is not a tomb. It is this: a woman on a mat, in a five-foot way, listening to the rain. The vigil is over. The digging is done.

What remains is home.
